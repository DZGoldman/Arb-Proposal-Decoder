    "description": "# AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency [UPDATED]\n\n## ATTENTION:\n\nThis is an updated version of a similar proposal that has been put up for a vote a day prior to this one. We have discovered that the target vesting contract in the previous proposal had an incorrect \"start\" date. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Please do not vote on the other proposal and vote on this proposal instead.\n\n### What happened?\n\nThe way this proposal works is that there is a special AIP smart contract (AIP1Point1Target) that references the location of the vesting vault for the Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet. The on-chain action that the proposal is executing is changing of the “passed” parameter on this AIP smart contract from false to true, documenting DAOs approval for the Foundation to use this referenced vesting vault, after the vote the Foundation will move 700M ARB tokens that are subject of AIP 1.1 to this contract and will be able to retrieve the vested amount to the Foundation’s multisig. \n\nOne parameter of this setup is a “start” timestamp, which determines the point in time from which the vesting schedule is being calculated. According to the text of AIP-1.1: “…ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO…”. So this timestamp should be set to 1681754400, which translates to Monday, 17 April 2023 18:00:00 GMT, the date of the Snapshot approval. However, in the vesting contract that was subject to the original vote, it has been wrongly set to the date of the ARB Airdrop (1679590871, which translates to Thursday, 23 March 2023 17:01:11 GMT). This means that the smart contract configuration did not reflect the text of the AIP and would result in the effective unlocked vested amount being too large.\n\n### Resolution\n\nSince we cannot cancel the vote at this point (it could be canceled by the Security Council, but only after the vote has passed), after thorough discussion, we have decided to create a new proposal with the correct smart contracts that are referenced in the vote. We recommend that the DAO ignore the other AIP-1.1 vote, and instead vote on this one.\n\nIf you’d like to check the parameters are set correctly this time, you can check (for example using Arbiscan) the AIP smart contract referenced by this vote: [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9E43f733Da0445b35f038FB34a6Fb8C2947B984C#code](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575). In the Contract tab you can go to the Read contract sub-tab and check that the arbitrumFoundationWallet parameter references smart contract at [0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844), which is the vesting vault. You can now go to this smart contract and, again, go to the Contract tab, and Read as Proxy sub-tab to see that the “start” parameter is set correctly to 1681754400. \n\nWe hope that this resolution will cause as little confusion as possible among delegates. We plan to publish \"lessons learned\" from this case at a later date to elaborate on this case and suggest certain procedures to be implemented in the future to minimize the chances of such mistakes happening again. \n\n\n***\n\n\nCategory: Non-constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n- Control over the DAO treasury\n- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Rationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\n- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)\n- General and Administrative: $16,000,000\n- R&D: $9,000,000\n- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000\n- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000\n- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000\n- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).\n\n### Links:\n\nPrevious version of this proposal with misconfiguration issue: [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\nSnapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae)\n\nGitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n\nForum discussion thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1)",

    "description": "# Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook\nAuthor Saurabh, Questbook\n\nType Non-Constitutional\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n\n## **Rationale (Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. Aligned allocation of funds: By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. Increased accountability: With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. Lower Turnaround Time (TAT): The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours. The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. Strong Brand Recognition : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas.\n\n### Specifications\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uIjprH3.png)\n\nWe propose [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants) for security purposes, furthermore, a Grants SAFE with a 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and four domain allocators, one member from the DAO. We will then have four SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/4 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, one more domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\n**[Questbook ARB DAO GRANTS](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants)** acts as a security layer for grants multisig, empowering ARB holders to control multisig when needed.\n\nCurrently, we have four signers on the Safe, and the Safe is 3/4  until the domain allocators are elected by the community. As a result, we will have three temporary signers:\n\n1. Saurabh - Program Manager\n2. Frisson - Arbitrum Delegate \n3. Coinflip - Arbitrum Delegate\n4. Matt Stable Labs - Arbitrum Delegate\n\nHere’s the multi-sig address: [0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308)\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0wompF.png)\n\n### Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n        \n![](https://i.imgur.com/IAmytlJ.png)\n\n2.  Grants Program: \n  a. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\n  b. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\n  c. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\n  d. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly    distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n1. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unused funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qz3RmPL.png)\n\n**P.S** \n\nWe are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Tally, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted. \n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’sDiscourseDiscord, TelegramSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)GitHub\n\nSubjective\n\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

    "description": "# AIP - 3 [Non-Constitutional] Fund the Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1\n**Proposer:** disruptionjoe.eth\n\n**Authors:** Plurality Labs\n\n# TL;DR\nThis proposal requests 3,360,000 ARB (0.07% of the total treasury) to fund the first of three milestones in a comprehensive plan to build an Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program.\n\n### Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\nMilestone 1 is the start of this journey with a funding request that breaks down as follows:\n\n### Fund Allocation\n- 2.5 million ARB: Funding Ecosystem Development\n- 300k ARB: Matching Gitcoin Funding Pools which use Arbitrum\n\n**Total Funds to be Allocated = 2.8 million ARB**\n\n### Services\n- 336k ARB (12%): Plurality Labs Services\n- 224k ARB (8%): Grant Program Managers\n\n**Total Service Fees (20%) = 560k ARB**\n\n#### Proposal Total = 3,360,000 ARB\n\nSuccessful completion of these Milestone 1 deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem further establishing Arbitrum as the go to scaling solution for Ethereum. Plurality Labs is committing to being held accountable for the following Milestone 1 deliverables.\n\n# Deliverables\nAt the end of Milestone 1 (Est. March 2024), Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n### Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops\n\n- Conduct DAO native sensemaking to find the Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values\n- Clearly define funding priorities including short & long-term goals & boundaries\n- Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n- Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n### Design | Construct best-in-class Pluralistic Grants Program\n\n- Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n- Design and process map the end-to-end grant funding flows\n- Design approach, process, and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n- Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n- Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n- Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n### Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs\n\n- Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n- Deploy 2.5 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n- Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n- Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n### Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes\n\n- Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes, and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n- Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n- Collate community feedback and input on grants programs' efficacy and success\n- Evaluate, review, and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow its ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “We can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n# Rational\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds\".\n\nAt its core, the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefit the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming-specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs have struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n- Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n- Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n- Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n- Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and  Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n- Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n- Domain expertise and knowledge\n- Ability to source innovative grants projects and support in the maintenance of a healthy pipeline of grants submission\n- Maturity of program-specific processes and tooling\n- Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of the mechanism\n- Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n- This is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nThe Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\nThis is not a payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to match the funding pools of programs willing to run on Arbitrum. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users who might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into the support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n\n\n# Improved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting\nImproved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model. Web3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spending. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well as specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand-alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n# Multisig Management\n## Grants Safety Multisig\nOn Tally, the request is to send 3.36 million ARB to the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig.\n\narb1:0xC158b555F0B1ddd7F4D4f97Fd2a9acd144f8e0D4\n\nThe 4/6 which includes 4 delegates with over 500k ARB plus 2 Plurality Labs team members. \n\n### Signers include:\n\n**Delegates**\n- Frisson (6.59m)\n -Soby (5.33m)\n- Coinflipcanda (4.95m)\n- Nathan (680k)\n\n**Plurality Labs**\n- Disruption Joe\n- Shawn Grubb\n\nThere are two layers of community protection against misuse or abuse of funds.\n\n### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n- DAO can clawback funds from multisig direct to its treasury with a vote\n- Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n### Grants Safety Multisig Signers\n\n- A multisig protects from simple wallet hacks\n- Protects from having the service provider hold all the funds\n- Protects against obvious self dealing or abuse\n- Provides a more integrated delegate watching the program closely\n- Does not decide how funds are allocated - Only a signer\n- This multisig is set up with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally. (Quorum is set at 100 million ARB for non-constitutional vote)\n\n## Role of Signers and Governance \nThe role of the multisig signer is solely to protect and prevent fraud and abuse such as perceived “self-dealing” by Plurality Labs. They are not expected to actively participate in deciding where funds should be allocated.\n\nThis multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program.\n\nDuring our sessions with the community, we learned that there is not an expectation of any election or term limits for this multisig because it does not actively make any decisions. Instead the requirements should be large delegates (skin in the game), active (will actually sign in timely manner), and has reputation (wants to maintain positive impression).\n\n***This vote will enable the DAO at any time to set term limits or request elections and for that request to be executed within 30 days. Governance requests for the Grants Safety Multisig will only require a winning vote on snapshot which meets non-constitutional quorum.***\n\n## Plurality Labs Payment\nUpon receipt of 3.36 million ARB, the Grants Safety Multisig will send 30% of the Plurality Labs service fee to the Plurality Labs wallet: arb1:0x76Ae3Af25332F5cd01c312E281685Bb35D7d27eA\n\nThe remaining 70% will be streamed to the Plurality Labs wallet over a period of 6 months. This means that if the DAO believes Plurality Labs is performing poorly, they can even clawback the payment to Plurality Labs.\n\nWe also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n# Plurality Labs Team\n### Disruption Joe\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million. First Gitcoin employee to leave the company and work full-time for the DAO. Started the Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD) workstream. FDD is responsible for stopping over $3 million in fraud while Gitcoin Grants delivered over $50 million in funding.\n\nMore reading about the work done in the FDD Review. Joe will be supporting overall project management and grants framework design.\n\n### Pepperoni Jo3 (on behalf of r3gen.finance 2)\n\nCofounder of r3gen, a web3 financial service provider working with clients including Squid, Coordinape, Inverse Finance and Treasure DAO. Previously PwC consulting alumni specializing in Org Design, Operational Excellence and Change. Joined web3 full time at Index Coop where he served on the Leadership Council as Head of People and Community.\n\nMore information on the r3gen services and team can be found here 2.\n\n### Mary Quandt\n\nPeople-first strategic design-thinking and organizational development leader. Partners with global business leaders to accelerate business strategies and execute people- and organization-focused solutions. Leadership approach combines possibility and participation while keeping firm foot in practical implementation. Thrives on building, leading and growing inclusive cross-functional teams to challenge the status quo. Experience includes IndexCoop, US Election Assistance Commission, Johnson & Johnson, Human Performance Institute, GE, Amazon, Martha Stewart and Charles Schwab to name a few.\n\n### Shawn Grubb\n\nAs former CIO, CEO, and non-profit chairman of the board, Shawn spent his corporate career preparing for DAO governance. Introduced to the blockchain in 2015 he went full-time degen in 2019 but moved to DAOs in 2021 when he joined Index Coop leading the governance communications and people operations. In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n# Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures… The same process will occur before Milestone 3.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. By the end of Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for the entire process to run autonomously onchain.\n\n## Milestone 3 - Completion of the full project\nWe expect this to take 18 months in total. Each milestone being a 6 month cycle of iterative improvement. At the end of the third milestone we will provide:\n\n### Metrics\n- The number of quality active developers building on Arbitrum is growing at an increasing rate. (The combination of a quality assessment and the nuance of an increasing rate of growth indicates healthy and sustainable growth.)\n- Voter participation is increasing as indicated by # of active ARB holders in participating in grants governance. (Participation, especially those buying ARB to participate, is a key indicator of ARB value as a governance token providing political decentralization.)\n- DAO delegates’ satisfaction with Plurality Labs service is improving as measured by NPS. (The delegate’s happiness with Plurality Labs service indicates success as viewed by the delegates.)\n\n### What will have been achieved?\n- Capture-resistant governance of the grants program which supports continuous and sustainable funding of the grants program going forward.\n- Ability to massively scale allocation amounts such that the DAO can comfortably allocate significant capital to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem by improving sourcing pipelines, standardizing evaluation models, and using multiple allocation methods appropriately aligned to outcomes.\n- Improvements in the DAOs ability to sense, make and drive impact and outcomes by bringing the right information to the right decision making apparatus in a way that cuts off poor performance and doubles down on high-impact work.\n\n# Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\n# Reference Discussions\n\nForum Discussion https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976\n\nSnapshot Passed 7/18 https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f",

    "description": "# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration\n# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [2nd Revision]\n\nThis is an amended draft proposal by the RARI Foundation, addressing community feedback.\n\n## Abstract \n\nThe Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible protocol, which is an indexer, orderbook and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders. \n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will be opting for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023 indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source [NFT Scan](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).\n\nThe open-source Rarible Protocol is specifically focused on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue. \n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it’s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by Rarible.com NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to): \n- Regular features on Rarible.com top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n- Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible’s and Rari Foundation's owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n- Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n- Leveraging Rarible's and Rari Foundation's press relations\n- Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework, in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale \n \nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum's commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity. \n\n## Key Terms\n\n**The Rari Foundation:** The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible protocol\n\n**Rarible Inc.:** A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible protocol.\n\n**Rarible Protocol:** Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer and orderbook) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\n**Rarible SDK:** A part of the Rarible protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n\n- It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including Rarible.com), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)). \n- Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. ️\n- API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, -Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL,  IMX, FLOW, TEZ, to name a few —all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n- The protocol’s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes. \n- User-friendly SDK allows you to seamlessly connect wallets, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more.  The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n- Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated orderbooks from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n- Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n- Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n- Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications \n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used. \n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n- Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n    - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n- Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n    - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain but the creation of orders is off-chain.\n- Rarible Public API\n    - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n- Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n    - Rarible’s multichain Indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement \n\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol \n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\n**Tasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol**\n\n- **Arbitrum API Integration:** This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n- **Node Preparation:** A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval \n- **Contract Deployment:** The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n- **Orderbook:** Rarible’s orderbook will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the protocol\nArbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n- **Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK:** This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n- **Debugging and Testing:** General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n- **Build Testnet for Arbitrum:** An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n\n## Timeline \n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks in total, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023. \n\n## Overall Cost \n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\n### Integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n**Duration:** 5 Weeks  \n**Costs:** 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = **100,000 $**)\n\n**Payment terms:**\n\n50% payable upon proposal approval\n\n50% payable upon completion (identified as the release of Rarible's protocol integration to Arbitrum, with the API up and running, contracts deployed, NFTs are queryable)\n\nThe 100,000 USD amount is payable in ARB under the exchange rate on the day of the proposal submission. As of Sept 13, the rate is 1 ARB = $0.785339, which translates to 127,351 ARB.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintainance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.\n",

    "description": "# AIP 9: Arbitrum Short-term Incentive Program\nNote: This proposal has been drafted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created consensus framework to distribute up to 50,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through January 31, 2024. \n\nGranted funds are expected to be distributed by the end of January 31, 2024. Participating grantees will be expected to self report data, dashboards, and summarize grant performance on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis provisional framework aims to allow delegates to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed ([1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/4-arbitrum-open-governance-call-26-07-2023/15559), [2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779), [3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/quit-shooting-the-dao-foundation-in-the-foot/15771/2), [4](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116)).\n\nThe goals of the framework are to:\n\n* **Support Network Growth**: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n* **Experiment with Incentive Grants**: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Find new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n* Create Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\nFollowing a successful [Snapshot Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01), the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply to delegates for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check achieved consensus and approved funding of up to 50,000,000 ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\n## Financial Proposal\n\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n\n* A ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and [application template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544) as articulated in this document.\n* Approval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n* A 50,000,000 ARB distribution to the [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B).\n* A 94,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\n  * 20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n    * Draft and review of multiple iterations of the STIP framework.\n    * Moderation of community calls and working group telegram.\n    * Coordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\n   * 54,000 to ARB Multisig Signers (6,000 ARB per Signer).\n   * 20,000 ARB to StableLab streamed weekly for organizing and highlighting applications and managing review processes. This includes:\n        * Overseeing forum application and review stages.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Collaboration with the Foundation for forum setup and oversight.\n       * Facilitation of Delegate x Grantee Community Calls during review periods.\n\n**Multisig Setup**\n\nThe [STIP-ARB 5/9 multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes the signers from the original PL-ARB multisig with the addition of to three community members (pending KYC):\n\n* Karel Vuong, Treasure DAO\n* Jack Sanniota, 404 DAO\n* Lindsey Winder, Hedgey Finance\n\nThis new multisig, the STIP-ARB multisig, includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, *not punish bad designs*.\n\n## What are the Eligibility Requirements?\n\nGrant Requirements:\n\n* Grantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n* Grantees must not farm their own incentive programs. \n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant's objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard .\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544). \n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds. \n\n## Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines\n\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\n\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there's no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\n\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n* Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $1.5M TVL.\n      * .>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $4M TVL.\n      * .>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n      * .> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n    * Meets one of the following criteria\n      * .> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n      * .> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n# Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?\n\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\n### Cycle 1\n\n1. Application Period (1 Week):\n\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application [Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544).\n\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2. Review Period (1 Week):\n\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\n\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3. Voting Period (1 Week):\n\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\n\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\n### Cycle 2\n\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n# Projected Timeline \nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 10, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\nSep. 20, 2023 - On-Chain Vote Begins\n\nRound 1 \n* Application Date Starts: September 20, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: September 27, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: September 28, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: October 3, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: October 4, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: October 11, 2023\n\nRound 2 (Subject to changes)\n* Application Date Starts: October 12, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: October 18, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: October 19, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: November 01, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: November 2, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: November 09, 2023\n\n\n# Overall Cost\n50,094,000 ARB.\n\n# Outstanding Questions and Concerns\n\n**What happens if the budget is exceeded?**\n\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and then on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\n**What will happen to excess funds?**\n\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\n**What is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?**\n\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of empowering delegates to process incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\n\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\n**How does the program determine whether to halt funding streams?**\n\nFunds can be stopped by the STIP-ARB Multisig with a 5/9 consensus. Funds will be stopped in the event of negligent actions in violation of the previously defined grant requirements. If halted, the multisig must publish the justification of its decision on the Arbitrum Forum. The stream can restart either through a Snapshot Veto or if the multisig decides the grantee has corrected their actions and it’s appropriate to continue.\n\n**What are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?**\n\n* **Community Support**: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n* **Network Activity**: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n* **Community Awareness**: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n* **Incentives Data**: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n\n***Regarding the StableLab Engagement** StableLab has offered to handle management of the forum process starting September 22, 2023 and has agreed to accept back pay (from the proposal's passing) via weekly streams forward through January 31, 2023. This arrangement was initiated due to their proactive outreach regarding a competitive rate and interest under unique time-constraints and circumstances. If at any point the multisig feels StableLab has not upheld diligence in its responsibilities the multisig is empowered to halt the stream and appoint a new service provided by election. \n\nFurther, due to these last-minute circumstances, the DAO is entitled to elect competitive service providers during the first voting round by signaling a competitive offer in this proposal thread. If a counteroffer(s) is endorsed by a delegate with over 500,000 ARB VP the DAO will hold an election for the remainder of the contract length (endorsement to avoid spam).\n\n\n",

As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.\n* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.\n* For all of our resources see here: svy.gg/stip-backfund \n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all \"approved but not funded proposals’’ from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.\n\nThis program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:\n\n* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.\n* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.\n* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance\n\n# Considerations\n\nBefore this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal’s structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls—including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group—to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.\n\nKey concerns discussed include:\n\n### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.\n\nKey issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:\n\n* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s\n* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates\n* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals\n* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved\n* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects\n* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity\n* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars\n\n### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.\n\nWhile the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:\n\n> “The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.” [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)\n\nExcess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.\n\nNoteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.\n\nProper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.\n\n[<img height=\"285\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a_2_624x285.jpeg\" />**1600×733 150 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a.jpeg)\n\n[<img height=\"356\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041_2_624x356.png\" />**1458×832 92.8 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041.png)\n\n### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn’t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.\n\nDuring our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP’s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP’s intended outcomes—specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the “best” option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.\n\nVoting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).\n\nIt’s helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:\n\n* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.\n* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum’s values and constitution.\n* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.\n\n# Motivation\n\n> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.\n\nHow can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nAn unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.\n\nThis AIP seeks to achieve STIP’s original motivations by:\n\n1. nearly doubling the sample size;\n2. adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and\n3. including protocols at different stages of development.\n\nThis AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.\n\nOne of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.\n\n# Rationale\n\n`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`\n\nArbitrum’s community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.\n\nThe Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.\n\nAbove all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO’s values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren’t met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren’t met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.\n\n# Key Terms:\n\n* Approved but not funded STIP proposals\n* AIP-9\n* Backfund\n* Extension\n* STIP\n* STIP Round 1\n* STIP Backfunded\n\n# Specifications:\n\n`Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.`\n\nWill approve funding of an additional 21.4M ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\nPlease note the STIP Backfund will leverage the multiple sections of [AIP-9 1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131) such as [Specification section](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5) and [Outstanding Questions and Concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#outstanding-questions-and-concerns-13) and specifically:\n\n* [Financial Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\n* [Multisig Setup](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7)\n* [Eligibility Requirements](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6) and [Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7).\n* [KPIs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\n\nSteps to Implement - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

    "description": "# Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal\n**Abstract:**\nThis proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as “Arbiters.” These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum’s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation:**\nThe Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1. Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\n2. Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n3. Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n4. Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in **shaping Arbitrum over the past two years**. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\n**Partial contribution value**\nSince 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.\n\n1. Provided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)\n2. Arbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.\n3. Establish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)The establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum’s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.\n4. Translate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.\n5. arbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.\n6. dock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.\n7. Some Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.\n8. arbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.\n\nFrom 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.\n\n***The following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved***\n\\[[arbiter Simple example table of contributions in different categories - Google Sheets 34](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit?usp=sharing)]\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n*Beneficiaries:*\nArbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.\n\n*Distribution of Incentives:*\nThe Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 24 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.\n\nCalculation: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB\n\n**Wallet Address Collection and Distribution:**\nArbiters’ contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor’s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.\n\n**Future Plans:**\nUpon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.\n\narbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOur goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.\nAs arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n**Milestones**\nWhen the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.\n\nAfter this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.\n\nYour insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.\n\n\n\n**List of Arbiters’ partial contributions and arbiter profile info,For the sake of DAO reps checking for updates, we’ve listed them separately**\n\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=336825191>\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=2082014896>\n\n*Additionally, the Arbiter with Discord ID BILLY#7943 has voluntarily forfeited his reward and split it equally amongst the other Arbiters, so we will be modifying the original forum proposal and will be changing the 25 Arbiters in the original proposal to 24, so that the final calculation will be: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB*",

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\nThis is a non-constitutional proposal.&#x20;\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

    "description": "# [Updated] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\nThis is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n* Added detail re. clawback functions on \\[Multi-Sig] + \\[Service Provider Streams]\n* Created the ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability] Governor via the Zodiac Governor Module: [Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP moved to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\nLink to passed Snapshot proposal: <https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44>\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Total Cost -**\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Security] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n\n1,000 ARB \\[per signer - per month for the 6-month term] \\[Multi-Sig Budget]\n\nUSD16,000 payable in ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\] 1**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Experimental Delegates Incentive System\n# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1.

[\\[OLD\\] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/c8a836d3-fac3-469a-bee8-993a562b21a3_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. Given the experimental nature of this program, they have committed to implementing any modification necessary to the program, including new parameters. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from a multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n**Zodiac module:** <https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum-delegate-incentives-zodiac-module>\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @maxlomu\n* @cattin\n\n**Multisig:** 0xff1f38f8cDae7C1B1B289FCF6f5C1AA234DF1443\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance.

    "description": "# Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee\n**Abstract** - The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is tasked with facilitating & administering various procurement frameworks within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, creating new procurement frameworks for DAO Ratification & creating a proposal for security-service subsidies.\n\n**Motivation** - Implementing the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) and its associated frameworks is essential for the Arbitrum community as it ensures a transparent, efficient, and accountable approach to procurement, benefiting the ecosystem by securing high-quality service providers via a preemptive quality assurance mechanism which is the procurement framework.\n\n**Rationale** - the ADPC will play a pivotal role in achieving further organization within the ArbitrumDAO. The mandate of the ADPC aims to create an optimal organizational framework for service procurement while also creating a marketplace for service providers that would have gone through preemptive quality assurance.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - The AIP passed Snapshot on the 9th of January 2024. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP is now proceeding to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the ADPC. Once the forecited steps are concluded the election process will commence.\n\nSpecifications & Timeline - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - For a 6-month term, $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) & 1,000ARB per Multi-sig member \\[per month]\n\n**The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 200,000ARB (a buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC Multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to procurement committee members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury)**\n\n***\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\nTL;DR\n\n* The ADPC (ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee) has the immediate mandate of overseeing the ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ recently ratified by the ArbitrumDAO.\n* The ADPC may add additional procurement frameworks that will be ratified through Snapshot.\n* The committee will research and propose a subsidy fund for security-oriented services within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. A ‘Means Test’ will be implemented to determine project eligibility for security service-fee subsidies.\n* The ADPC will establish procurement frameworks for various verticals and service types within the ArbitrumDAO.\n* Three members will be elected to the ADPC through Snapshot’s weighted voting system.\n* Eligibility criteria for members include experience, integrity, conflicts of interest disclosure, industry knowledge, analytical skills, financial acumen, communication skills, negotiation skills, project management abilities, ethical conduct, teamwork, technology proficiency, and decision-making skills.\n* The election process involves application submission, KYC/KYB review, and member election via Snapshot.\n* The ADPC’s term is 6 months, with a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month)\n* Operational parameters include meeting minutes, monthly reports, bi-weekly calls, and a public dashboard.\n* The ADPC’s Multi-Sig will be a 3/5 with signers receiving 1,000 ARB per month for their services. Signers cannot be Procurement Committee members.\n* Streaming of funds and clawback capabilities are implemented for multisig accountability.\n* The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* The Agreement will cover appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards for ADPC members.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the ‘ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee’ or ‘ADPC’) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC’s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ADPC’s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ \\[REF:[Proposal \\[Non-Constitutional\\]: \\*\\*Procurement Framework \\[Security Service Providers\\]\\*\\* 15](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704) & [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.\n\nComposition of the ADPC \\[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]\n\n**\\[i] MANDATE**\n\n1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \\[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \\[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\n**Steps \\[2], \\[3] & \\[4] of the mandate will necessarily have to be coupled with a 14-day consultation period pre-structuring so that input is solicit from the ArbitrumDAO and other relevant third-parties. The input collated during the public consultation period will necessarily need to be made public.**\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant’s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one’s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization’s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

This package includes a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.\n\n**TERM**\n\nThe duration of the ADPC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.\n\n**ADPC \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ADPC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* DisruptionJoe \\[Plularity Labs]\n* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) \\[Premia Finance]\n* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)\n* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)\n* Dan \\[Vela]\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\nThe Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ADPC Multi-Sig via the [Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ADPC.](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability)\n\nIn addition, after the ADPC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ADPC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.\n\n**CHECKS & BALANCES**\n\nThe ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:\n\nAppointment & Termination: ADPC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.\n\n* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:\n\n“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \\[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \\[[$2.03 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)].\n\n* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:\n\n“ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:\n\n1.

    "description": "# Long Term Incentives Pilot Program\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP establishes a Long-term Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute a maximum of 45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum that were not funded during STIP or the Backfund. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Testing Incentives Mechanisms For a Long-Term Framework\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has spent the last few months experimenting with incentive programs to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum. There is a consensus the DAO will use what we learn from these short-term programs to establish a long-term framework. While STIP V1 brought tons of attention to Arbitrum and has resulted in [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in protocol metrics, we have learned there were many flaws with the structure of STIP Round 1. This Pilot Program looks to implement new mechanisms to address the issues seen during STIP. The DAO will use this Pilot Program as a test run for a long-term framework before committing to a year-long program.\n\nThe Pilot Program will operate using a Council, have Advisors to ensure protocols receive adequate feedback and assistance, and allow protocols more freedom to create innovative ARB incentive plans. We believe these changes will help remedy many of the pain points seen in Round 1. Running the Pilot Program to test these new features will allow the DAO to compare different program methods before implementing a long-term framework beginning in Q2 2024. This will help ensure we have all the knowledge necessary to implement the most effective long-term incentives program for Arbitrum.\n\n### Why Protocols Need a Round 2\n\nSTIP was an experimental program to distribute ARB to protocols to use as incentives for their users. While it was initially intended to have two rounds, the program was substantially more popular than expected, and the entire 50M ARB budget was used in Round 1 and an additional 21.4M ARB was passed through STIP Backfund for teams that were “approved but not funded”.\n\nThis meant no funds remained for Round 2, leading to its cancellation. Many protocols either missed the Round 1 deadline, intentionally waited for Round 2 or simply did not know about STIP. This left several protocols with no alternative route to apply for ARB incentives.\n\nMany STIP Round 1 grantees have seen [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in their metrics. This Pilot Program would allow protocols that missed out on Round 1 the opportunity to apply to gain these benefits, which will help level the playing field for these protocols. The Pilot Program will replace a round 2 and will be funded with 45M ARB to accommodate the large expected protocol demand we have already seen. This will complete the incentivizing of Arbitrum-based teams to create a holistic competitive edge not against each other but against other chains.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere is a DAO consensus that Arbitrum will need a long-term incentive program in 2024. However, many delegates feel the DAO is moving too quickly and spending too much money on backfund or V2 proposals without yet receiving any of the data on STIP’s effectiveness.\n\nWe have learned a lot from STIP and can use what went wrong in STIP and the Backfund to hypothesize what changes would create a better long-term framework. However, we have little evidence to prove these new ideas would be a better solution. DAO members currently don’t have the resources or funds to create a long-term program, nor do we understand what a good long-term program looks like.\n\nThis proposal focuses on obtaining this evidence using a committed working stream to guarantee we come away from this program ready to make informed decisions on a long-term framework. The pilot program also allows the DAO to test new aspects of an incentive program such as Advisors, Councils, and more flexible incentive distributions before committing long-term.\n\nThis will help save the DAO money and time in the long term by preventing the need for more short-term programs before we are ready to commit to the Long-Term Framework.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Problem / Solutions:\n\nThe specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.\n\n#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates\n\nIn the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.\n\n#### Solution #1: Elected council\n\nTo remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals\n\nA major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.\n\n#### Solution #2: Advisors\n\nThe Pilot Program introduces Advisors to assist protocols throughout the pilot program. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications and eventually their incentive programs. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.\n\n#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms\n\nSTIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.\n\n#### Solution #3\n\nThe Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don’t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.\n\n## Flow of Pilot Program\n\n#### Application Period (2 week)\n\nProtocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)\n\nDuring the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.\n\nProtocols can continuously adjust their requested ARB amounts until the feedback period is finished. No changes can be to the requested ARB amount during the screening period.\n\nStableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.\n\n#### Screening Period (1 week)\n\nDuring this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe rubric will be created by the Council and Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.\n\nThe council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB\n\nEXAMPLE: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB\n\n50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each → Council grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrows the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget → 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council’s decisions → 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of “fund” votes → 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO\n\n#### Voting Period (1 Week)\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented to the DAO for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds.\n\n#### Compliance Period (3 weeks)\n\nAll protocols that successfully pass the voting period will undergo a KYC period during these three weeks. Arbitrum Foundation members will reach out to coordinate these KYCs. All protocols will be required to complete the KYC during this period or they may be disqualified from receiving funds.\n\nOnce all KYCs are completed, there will be one vote to ratify the DAOs selection of screened and KYC’d protocols. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, protocols will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution.\n\n#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)\n\nSelected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using a template created by the Council and Advisors. Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.\n\nDuring this period Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\n### The Council\n\nThe council will comprise 5 members. These members should be unbiased and knowledgeable builders, delegates, or organizations with experience in incentive programs, grants councils, or growing a protocol.\n\nThe council will decide which protocols will progress to a snapshot vote to be awarded the ARB incentives. The council **does not need to spend** the entire incentives budget should they feel there are not enough quality applications. **Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO to be used in the Long Term Framework.**\n\nThe council members will be responsible for creating a rubric that all protocols will be judged against. The council will design this rubric with input from the Advisors and will communicate what they are looking for with the Advisors to ensure the Advisors guide protocols in the right direction. The highest-scoring protocols will progress to Snapshot votes to allow the DAO to determine if they should receive ARB. The council will be responsible for publishing the graded rubrics as well as a brief explanation for all decisions.\n\nThe council will also be responsible for determining when to halt a protocol’s stream should they violate program rules or misuse funds. All reports of violations will be evaluated by the council. It will require 4 out of 5 council members to vote in favor of halting the stream for a stream to be stopped. Council members will coordinate with the multi-sig signers to halt a stream. Streams can also be halted via a DAO snapshot vote should the DAO disagree with the council’s judgment.\n\n#### Council Not required to Use entire 45M ARB Budget\n\nWhile 45 million was the DAO’s [selected budget](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a), the Council does not need to allocate the full amount. The council is responsible for screening applications and will only progress applications they view as worthy of moving to Snapshot. The total funding amount of applications moved to snapshot can be anywhere between 0 and 45M ARB. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury by the multisig.\n\n#### Council Selecting Research Bounties\n\nThe council will create the RFPs for the research bounties.\n\nEach RFP will include the research question that should be answered as well as the maximum budget for the bounty. While there is 200,000 ARB allocated for research bounties the council does not need to allocate the entire budget. Arbitrum delegates will then select who will complete each of these RFPs via a snapshot election.\n\n#### Council Election\n\nThe 5 council members have been selected by [DAO vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4). The 5 Council Applicants with the most votes were elected to serve on the council for the Pilot Program.\n\nThose who serve on the Pilot Program Council are not guaranteed to be included on a council in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select council members when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\n#### Council Members\n\nCouncil members have been elected via [Snapshot vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4) and are listed below.\n\n* GFX Labs\n* 404 DAO\n* Wintermute\n* GMX\n* Karel Vuong\n\n#### Council Conflict of Interest\n\nShould a Council member have a conflict of interest with an applicant they may excuse themselves from grading said applicant. A conflict of interest can include an investment or close personal ties to an applying protocol. Should this happen the council member will have to disclose they are not grading and provide a reason.\n\nShould there be a dispute over whether the circumstances qualify as a conflict of interest the other council members will vote on whether or not the situation warrants the council members abstaining from grading that applicant.\n\n#### Removing Council Members\n\nShould the DAO feel a member or members of the council are not fulfilling their duty they may remove them using a snapshot vote.\n\nAnyone with sufficient voting power can initiate a Snapshot poll to remove council member(s). Should the poll receive a majority “remove” votes the council member(s) will be immediately removed.\n\nShould this occur there will then be a week-long application process where replacement council members can apply via the forum. This will be followed by a Snapshot vote to elect replacement member(s)\n\n#### Council Cost Breakdown\n\nEach council seat will receive **25,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize council members to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the council’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"492\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb_2_690x492.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\")\n\n\n\n#### Council Responsibilities:\n\n* Design an application template and grading rubric with the help of Advisors\n* Grade all protocols against the rubric to determine who will progress to snapshot vote\n* Provide public reasoning for all funding decisions made\n* Decide whether a protocol’s funding should be halted if they violate the rules or fail to distribute ARB\n* Create research bounty RFPs\n* Pick retrofunding mechanisms and allocations for the DAO to vote on\n\n### Incentive Advisors\n\n#### Overview\n\nThree Advisors will help protocols design, implement, and iterate their incentive programs. Advisors are integral to the proposal process, serving as impartial entities with DeFi expertise. Their primary function is to provide detailed, unbiased feedback on applications, aiding protocols in refining and improving their submissions.\n\nThe Advisors will also work closely with the council to create the application template and grading rubric. This will ensure the council and advisors are on the same page so they can provide the best feedback to applicants and ensure the council understands the details of the incentive mechanisms the Advisors are helping protocols design.\n\nAs this is an experimental addition to the incentives framework, having expert advisors working with protocols will help protocols and the DAO understand what is most helpful from an advisor and allow the DAO to adjust the role for the longer-term framework. This will also help protocols design more innovative incentive distribution mechanisms that can be tested to see how effective they are going into a long-term incentives framework.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n*Collaboration with Council and Program Manager:* Work jointly to design the application template, KPIs, and a grading rubric, ensuring alignment with council expectations and clarity in the evaluation process.\n\n*Feedback and Recommendations:* Offer detailed feedback on each eligible application assigned to your team during the review period.\n\n*Communication with Applicants:* Engage actively with applicants to streamline the application process, aiding in proposal improvements and clarifications.\n\n*Hosting Office Hours:* Schedule and conduct public office hours 3 times per week while the program is running for protocols to seek advice. This will focus on transparency and accessibility. All interactions during these sessions will be recorded and summarized for everyone. Order of speaking during office hours will be on a first come first serve basis.\n\n#### Expectations\n\n*Impartiality*: Advisors must remain unbiased, especially as they do not have the final say in proposal acceptance. While Advisors will work closely with the council members to create the Rubric, advisors should not interfere with the votes from the council nor guarantee any outcome to projects they speak with.\n\n*Continuous Engagement:* Post-application feedback is crucial, as is ongoing involvement in the later stages of the process, subject to discussion and agreement with relevant parties. There may also be later involvement in the process when the program is running or over.\n\n#### Timeline and Process\n\n*Pre-Application Phase*: Advisors we assist the Council with the design of the application template and grading rubric. Advisors are required to hold open office hours, focusing on guiding applicants in preparing their proposals.\n\n*Application Review Phase*: Each proposal receives at least one detailed feedback report addressing key criteria established by the DAO.\n\n*Post-Application Feedback*: After the submission of proposals, advisors provide insights on the process and suggest improvements for future cycles.\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThose who serve as a Pilot Program Advisor are not guaranteed to be included onboarded in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select Advisors when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\nThe Advisors have been elected via [Snapshot vote 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc) and are listed below.\n\n* JoJo\n* SEEDLatam Gov\n* Castle Capital\n\n#### Advisor Budgets\n\nEach Advisor will receive **35,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Advisor’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"674\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353_2_674x500.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\")\n\n\n\n### The Multisig\n\nA new multisig will be created for this program. A few individuals from the original [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) used in Round 1 and the backfund proposal are now serving as council members in LTIPP which could create a conflict of interest. Additionally, a new multisig will help to prevent confusion regarding which funds are from STIP and which belong to LTIPP. Finally, a new multisig reduces redundancy of signers across multiple DAO programs which helps to protect the DAO by increasing decentralization.\n\nThe new [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A) will be a ⅗ multisig and include:\n\n1. Lindsey\n2. Limes\n3. Joseph\n4. Bobbay\n5. Alex Lumley\n\nMulti-sig address: 0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A\n\nThe funds in the multisig belong to the DAO, and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. In LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams and can coordinate with the multi-sig signers so they can enact this request. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\nThe multisig includes two features to ensure the accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grant’s duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n#### Multisig Budget\n\nEach Multisig signer will receive **1,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nIn LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams. This has decreased a significant amount of the multisig’s workload. Due to this, the budget has been lowered from the STIP budget.\n\n### Program Manager\n\nThe Program Manager will be responsible for coordinating between all parties involved to ensure the Pilot Program runs smoothly. They will be available to answer any questions the DAO has regarding the Pilot Program and will publish bi-weekly reports so the community understands the status of the program. This role is designed to add efficiency and clarity to all aspects of the Pilot Program. The Program Manager will have no input into which protocols receive funds. However, they will be responsible for handling any operational tasks that arise throughout the Pilot Program.\n\nMatt from StableLab will act as the program manager. StableLab will function in a similar capacity as they did for STIP Round 1. They will help coordinate between the multisig, council, Advisors, applicants, foundation, and community to ensure the Pilot Program program runs smoothly. StableLab will serve as a neutral party and have no power to decide which protocols receive funding or which streams are halted.\n\nStableLab was responsible for designing this Pilot Program and will continue working on designing a long-term Framework with the help of the incentives working group and the DAO. StableLab will be responsible for publishing a research report on the effectiveness of the Pilot Program and their findings on how it operationally compared to STIP V1.\n\nShould the DAO feel StableLab is not fulfilling their duties as program manager, they may remove them using a snapshot vote. An emergency Snapshot vote will then be used to elect a replacement program manager.\n\nIn the Long Term Incentives Framework, this position will be decided by the DAO. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, it will continue using StableLab’s services given they have experience from managing STIP V1 and already have knowledge from designing this process.\n\n#### Program Manager Budget and Responsibilities\n\nThe Program Manager will receive **70,000 ARB** total streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe Program Manager will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Program Manager’s responsibilities and the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\nResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensation**Pre Application period*** Setting up council/advisor elections* Coordinating between council and advisors to ensure rubrics and templates are created* Connecting data provider to council and advisors* Preparing forum application set up* Creating systems for the Council and Advisors to track progress of applications40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Application Period*** Guiding protocols on the application process* Checking Protocol eligibility* Providing announcements regarding stages of the application period* Coordinating and broadcasting Advisor Office hours to applicants* Connecting applicants to their Advisors* Assisting Council and Advisors to stay organized and ensure they are properly reviewing each applicant* Closing applications at deadline40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARB**Screening / Voting Period*** Providing operational assistance to the council to help with communication and process of screening protocols and protocols and release of rubrics* Coordinate between foundation and protocols to finish KYC* Preparing snapshot votes for protocols that pass the council screening process* Organizing Hedgey Streams for selected protocols* Answering questions from delegates regarding how to vote* Communicating with DAO to keep everyone updated on the progress of the program as well as which protocols will move to vote* Encourage delegates to vote plus guide them to applications/feedback to make informed choices.40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Incentives Period:*** Help data provider connect with protocols to ensure proper data is collected* Coordinating and ensuring Protocols post their updates* Bringing concerns of misuse of funds to the council* Organize research bounty RFP selection process* Answer stream questions from protocols* Help protocols who have questions regarding the incentive rules/timelines* Addressing issues between protocols and their advisor* Provide Bi-weekly updates on the status of the program30 hours per week for 12 weeks = 360 hours29,998.8 ARB**Post Incentives*** Coordinating retroactive funding.* Coordinating Reflection Pieces from contributors* Conducting reflection interviews with applicants, contributors, and delegates* Providing operational reflection reports and recommendations for future programs.* Ensuring all unused arb is transferred back to the treasury40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARBTotal= 840 hours70,000 ARB\n\n### Data and Analytics Provider\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Pilot Program will onboard OpenBlock Labs as a service provider for data and analytics monitoring and reporting.\n\nTo optimize each initiative, the DAO must collect and analyze data regarding the efficacy of incentives. For the two prior incentive programs, the DAO has partnered with OpenBlock Labs to provide robust incentive data, which can be found [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum). In addition to the data, OpenBlock provides biweekly updates to the forum, and has collaborated with dozens of protocols and delegates to share meaningful insights; our most recent analysis can be found [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-bi-weekly-stip-efficacy-update-1-19/20759/1).\n\nIn the following section, we outline OpenBlock’s scope for the LTIPP.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n***Incorporate Past Learnings:*** Collaborate with LTIPP advisors to strategically distribute incentive budgets across categories and protocols, utilizing insights derived from OpenBlock’s STIP efficacy analysis. Our previous endeavors have uncovered millions of dollars in unoptimized spending, and we are confident that OpenBlock is well-positioned to guide the DAO in implementing improvements based on these insights.\n\nTo illustrate these insights more vividly, we present two examples of real scenarios within the STIP where OBL’s recommendations could effectively guide substantial capital allocation in a meaningful direction, showcasing the potential ROI of OBL’s work:\n\n***1. Concentration of Rewards:*** A handful of protocols have dispersed the majority of their rewards (50-70% or more) to a small group of users (less than 10). In such cases, the DAO is essentially committing millions of dollars to highly concentrated bets on user acquisition. Frequently, these major stakeholders have vested interests in the protocol, resulting in rewards flowing toward rent-seeking participants. The underlying data is available in the “User Claim Activity” section [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/claims).\n*2. Excessive Spending:* Some protocols have distributed significant rewards without showing substantial additional growth compared to their pre-STIP trajectory, as observed in our competitive analysis control groups. Leveraging the data, OBL can offer insights on optimizing allocations and implementing mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of incentive spending. This includes setting specific performance targets to guide the continued deployment of funds. Since we have already spent a lot of time investing in these relationships with protocols, we are in a prime position to efficiently offer these services. The underlying data is available in the “Protocol Metrics Normalized” section [here 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview).\n\n***Protocol Data Aggregation:*** Interface with each protocol to audit and aggregate data on their KPIs. Monitor efficacy through a diverse set of metrics, mirroring the approach taken in the STIP (such as nominal TVL/volume/fees/DAU growth at the protocol level, normalized by claimed ARB, competitive intelligence, aggregated data at the category and ecosystem levels, etc.). Leverage any additional resources to help teams optimize their incentive mechanisms by building more granular insights. To provide more clarity on the resources required for this section, we have detailed the scope below:\n\n*Protocol-Specific:*\n\n1. Reach out and establish connections with protocols and their data teams.\n2. Audit existing queries for accuracy and relevance.\n3. Understand the KPIs and metrics associated with their queries.\n4. Build new queries or modify existing ones based on identified KPIs.\n5. Implement ETL processes. Manage separate ETL streams for teams with data in APIs or other platforms.\n6. Create visualizations tailored to each protocol.\n7. Collaborate with protocols to appropriately label their contract addresses.\n8. Flag any instances of misbehavior to the organizing team.\n\n*Aggregate:*\n\n1. Track the flow of funds within the protocols.\n2. Develop aggregate views based on the ecosystem.\n3. Conduct competitive intelligence analysis spanning various ecosystems.\n4. Generate aggregate views covering all categories within the ecosystems.\n5. Research efficacy metrics and establish normalization standards.\n6. Compile biweekly reports summarizing findings and insights. Engage with the community and iterate on findings to inform recommendations.\n\n***Making Data Publically Available:*** The Data provider will be responsible for making the data behind each dashboard publicly available. This will ensure those completing the Research Bounties have access to this information so they can provide proper analysis of this data. Easy access to data will allow for the Bounty completers to provide better reports and data visualizations for the community. This provides the DAO with a decentralized method for analyzing and understanding how effective this program is as well as better setting up the DAO for the Long Term Framework.\n\n***Monitor For Misuse of Funds:*** The data provider will monitor data from all funded protocols to detect any misuse of funds. Should they find suspicious activity the data Provider will be responsible for sharing this with the Council.\n\n***Create a Recap Report:*** The Data provider will be responsible for creating a recap report that tells the story of the Pilot Program and breaks down the successes and failures of the different incentive strategies.\n\n***Biweekly updates:*** The data provider will provide biweekly updates of the overall themes, trends, and findings from the program.\n\n***Interface with the council, advisors and protocols:*** The analytics providers have access to a wealth of incentive data, thus they are expected to leverage this data to provide feedback to teams who are designing incentive programs.\n\n***Interface with the research bounties and community:*** The analytics provider should work with the research bounty teams and any interested community members to ensure all data is open source and available for teams to access and interact with.\n\n#### Expectations\n\nImpartiality: The Data Provider must remain unbiased. While the Data providers will not have the power to halt streams themselves, they must be impartial when it comes to reporting the data and examining for any misuse of funds. Any suspicious behavior they find must be communicated to the council for further review.\n\nContinuous Monitoring: The Data Provider must continually update the data to reflect the latest updates. This will ensure the bounty researchers and community have access to the correct information. They also must continually monitor for misuse of funds to allow the council to act quickly should any issues arise\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThis will be an elected position in the long-term program. Additionally, given the long-term framework will have a much larger scope and will include many separate incentive categories, it will most likely require the DAO to onboard multiple different organizations to handle the long-term framework’s data monitoring and reporting. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, the Data provider will be selected and ratified by the DAO similar to STIP round 1.\n\n#### Data Provider Budget\n\nThe Data and Analytics Provider will receive **100,000 ARB** streamed throughout the program.\n\nFor this budget, OpenBlock Labs will commit 3 full-time equivalent data scientists.\n\nDuring this time they will be responsible for:\n\n* Using the data and learnings they gathered during STIP to:\n  * Help the advisors recommend strong incentive ideas to applicants\n  * Help inform the council as to what a quality applicant looks like\n* Meet with all successful applicants to create public dashboards displaying all required metrics\n  * Make the data open source so the research bounty teams have easy access to all data\n* Monitor all incentive programs for misuse of funds and report any finding to the council\n* Communicate with Research Bounty teams via telegram to ensure they have full access and understanding of the data that has been collected from the protocols\n* Provide Bi-weekly updates regarding the progress of the program.\n* Creating a final report with recommendations for how to structure future incentive programs.\n\n### Proposal Authors\n\nThis proposal has been continuously worked on by the authors since the middle of November after requests from the DAO emerged to create an alternative round 2 of STIP. The protocol authors have drafted the proposal, met with delegates for feedback, presented open workshopping calls, implemented feedback, and progressed the proposal towards a vote for the past few months. This funding section retroactively compensates the proposal authors for the hundreds of hours of work put into creating this proposal.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the three contributors as well as their time commitments over the past few months of creating this proposal.\n\nTotal Cost **30,000 ARB**\n\nContributorResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensationStableLabAuthoring the proposal, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches30 hours per week for 8 weeks = 240 hours15,000 ARBAlex LumleyAssisting in proposal design, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches20 hours per week for 8 weeks = 160 hours10,000 ARBBobby BolaAdvising proposal design, assisting with delegate outreach and feedback10 hours per week for 8 weeks = 80 hours5,000 ARBTotal450 hours30,000 ARB\n\n### Research Bounties\n\nThe Pilot Program proposal will include research bounties to ensure the DAO collects sufficient data and draws meaningful conclusions from STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program to help inform the future LTIP design. There will be up to 200,000 ARB available to those who complete bounties.\n\nThis process guarantees the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\n\nThe Council will be responsible for creating the research bounties RFPs that will include what question the research should answer as well as a maximum budget.\n\nSome possible questions the bounties could address are:\n\n* Which protocol incentive designs were most effective at attracting sticky users/liquidity?\n* What is an appropriate budget for a Long Term Incentives Incentive Program?\n* What was more effective the council or delegates voting?\n* What category of protocol received the most funding? Were any categories left out?\n\nNote: See more [community-created research buckets in the forum here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-research-bounties-for-ltipp/20378)\n\nResearchers will then apply to claim these bounties by providing why they are the best fit to answer the question as well as providing a budget.\n\nThe DAO will be responsible for selecting who completes each bounty based on the applicant’s experience and proposed budget.\n\nThe 200,000 ARB is the maximum amount spent on research bounties. Should the DAO choose to fund lower budgets, any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Retroactive Community Funding\n\nIn STIP Round 1 we saw many community members go above and beyond by providing valuable contributions without any funding. 100,000 ARB will be allocated for retroactive funding to community members who add valuable contributions during the Pilot Program. Earmarking these funds upfront lets people know there will be retro funding which will encourage community members to contribute. This section is intentionally vague to encourage all kinds of community contributions. The DAO will have the final say in how these funds will be used.\n\nThe exact methods used to distribute the funds will be selected by the DAO. The council will create a list of possible ways to retroactively distribute funds to those who have contributed to the Pilot Program. The DAO will then vote on which retroactive method(s) should be used. The DAO will also decide on who these retroactive payments will go to.\n\n### Arbitrum Delegates\n\nThis program is designed to reduce the large burden delegates faced during STIP round 1. While many of their responsibilities will be taken on by the Council and Advisors, the Arbitrum delegates will still retain the final say in many aspects of this proposal.\n\nDelegates will retain the following powers:\n\n* Elect Council Members and Advisors\n* Ratify all additional roles included in this proposal\n* Remove any position holder via a snapshot vote should the delegates feel they are not fulfilling their responsibilities\n* Vote on all incentive proposals selected by the council.\n* Select who fulfills the research bounties\n* Select the Method of distributing Retro Funding\n* Select who receives retro Funding\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nThe pilot program is for protocols that did not receive ARB during STIP or the Backfund. However, protocols that received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, Questbook’s grant program, or any other Arbitrum Grants program are eligible to receive Pilot Program funding. Additionally, receiving funding from the Pilot Program does not prohibit protocols from applying for funding from other DAO or foundation programs including the Long Term Incentives Program.\n\n#### Additional eligibility requirements\n\n* Grantees must be live on Arbitrum at the time of application\n* Grantees must refrain from farming their own incentive programs.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake Sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantee’s application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* The Council and Advisors have already started creating the application template and rubric\n* When the Tally vote ends the Application period will begin the next business day. Protocols will apply using the application template\n* At the same time, applicants will begin the KYC process with the foundation to expedite the process should they receive funding.\n* The Advisors and the council will begin providing feedback on proposals on a first come first serve basis.\n* Once this proposal passes the on-chain vote, the total amount of ARB will be sent to the [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A).\n* During the review period, the Protocols will work with Advisors to improve their applications.\n* During the review period, the council begins creating the research bounty questions.\n* All protocols that pass through the council screening phase, pass KYC, and sign grant agreements will move to a snapshot.\n* Applicants who pass the snapshot will have their streams automatically funded\n* Successful applicants will receive incentives for 12 weeks and will provide bi-weekly updates\n* The community will vote on who will fulfill the research bounties\n* The community will vote on Retrofunding\n* After the completion of the program, final reports will be posted to the forum\n* Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n### Total Cost: 45,735,000 ARB\n\n* **Incentives**: 45,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each\n* **Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each\n* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.\n* **Data and Analytics Provider**: 100,000 ARB for data monitoring and reporting\n* **Program Manager**: 70,000 ARB for program design, organization, management, and research report. See the full list of responsibilities above.\n* **Proposal Authors**: 30,000 ARB Total. 15,000 to StableLab, 10,000 to Alex, and 5,000 to Bobby paid retroactively for writing proposals, hosting proposal office hour calls, and communicating with delegates to gather feedback.\n* **Retroactive Community Funding:** 100,000 ARB\n* **Multisig Signers**: 5,000 ARB - 1,000 ARB each\n\n# Voting Options\n\n1.

    "description": "# [Non-constitutional] Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)\n## Introduction\n\nBack in August, Arbitrum DAO passed our AIP-3 to build a pluralistic grants framework that decentralizes grants decision-making, avoids capture and scales valuable grants allocations, and grows the Arbitrum ecosystem overall.\n\nOur proposal [passed on Tally](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976) with ~99% of delegate votes. It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:\n\nNearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.\n\n## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)\n\nAcross Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.\n\nExperimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/19f2561a1ec3653e1dbc41d5a646874c679c4d6a_2_621x415.jpeg)\n\n* Grow = double-down / start to scale\n* Coach = make changes / try again\n* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program\n\nIn Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.\n\n\\[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]\n\n### Milestone 1a Wins include:\n\n* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))\n* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.\n* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.\n* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 1a Lessons:\n\n* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn’t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn’t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won’t make that mistake again.\n* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn’t. Going forward, we’ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We’re excited to tell it.\n* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay “true” to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We’ll use all available resources this time.\n\n### Vision\n\nWe have a big vision. We’re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.\n\nThis is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking… and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.\n\nWe will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we’re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge).\n\n## Milestone 1(bridge):\n\nIn our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of…\n\nThere seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.\n\nThus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.\n\nIn Milestone 1b, we will show:\n\n1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.\n2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.\n3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.\n4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.\n\nTo ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:\n\n1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.\n2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We’ll use it.\n3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.\n\nHere’s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):\n\nPlurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.\n\nThis board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted \"No\" to our temp check for Milestone 2!\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81db971f7a5e9910d522a44171d3f3625bffb3cb_2_936x702.jpeg)\n\nHuman Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).\n\nTeam revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).\n\n## Cost\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.\n\nThe 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework.

If we do our work right (and we believe we’re on the right track) we should be spurring thriving, net-positive ecosystem activity in Arbitrum for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be doing it via a pluralistic grants framework that has a consistent bias for value creation, further decentralization, and resistance to capture. We will be building the future of web3 together, and providing a path for all great people and teams to work with Arbitrum.\n\nWhen the value of Milestone 1b is obvious, we’ll present Milestone 2.",

    "description": "# Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program\nTL;DR : This proposal aims to support the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury into assets that are stable in value with minimal volatility, liquid in conversion and provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \"risk free rate of return\" of US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in\n\n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with successful applicants.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons\n\n1. Our conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product. Another way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it’s in the form of an investment we earn yield from and can recall at anytime, rather than a grant. More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support programs.&#x20;\n2. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs. Creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified  committee that evaluates applicants and prepares an Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs on Arbitrum.&#x20;\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check ([COMPLETE](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5050ef61a4cbff56344ad558c2c880b547fef3b81df607818238ed3031f840b3))\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered (COMPLETE)\n3. Onchain Tally vote (March 20th to April 3rd)\n4. Receive applications from service providers (submission window April 5th to May 5th );\n5. Committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research (May 5th to June 5th)\n6. Snapshot vote for approval of recommended allocations between service providers (June 20th)\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4.

The Assessment Report prepared by the committee will contain a recommended division of the sanctioned amount between service providers, which the DAO can approve or reject via Snapshot vote. Other details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 300,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n\n* 150,000 ARB between 6 committee members (25k ARB per committee member is equivalent to the LTIPP Grants Council members)\n* 50,000 ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation for payment of outside legal counsel\n* 100,000 ARB for additional due diligence required by the committee and to program manager for management oversight and monitoring of selected providers.\n  **Candidates for STEP Program Manager will be selected by a vote of the** [**procurement committee**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), valid for a period of one year, after which they need to return to the DAO for a vote on paying their retainer fees. In case they do not get approval and there is no program manager overseeing our investments, the Arbitrum Foundation will liquidate and return assets to the treasury\n\nDuties of the program manager in the pre-allocation phase, for which we received a quotation of $1000 per application, include:\n\n1. Receiving applications from service providers\n2. Conduct a first pass on applications received; filter out incomplete applications or those not fitting the RFP\n3. After the committee reviews valid applications and shortlists eligible providers, prepare an assessment report on each provider that allows for easy comparison between them\n\nPost allocation duties, for which we received a quotation of $100,000 per year plus $15k for every selected provider, include;\n\n**1. Cashflow & Accrual Monitoring:** Enable the Arbitrum Foundation to easily ensure that the Arbitrum Treasury receives timely payments or accruals.

Supplementary\n\n**Summary and Arbitrum info**\n\n**Introduction**\nArbitrum governance is seeking proposals from qualified applicants for the purposes of diversifying the governance treasury and supporting ecosystem growth.\n\nThe purpose of the RFP is to identify products that provide trading volume and depth (i.e., liquidity), are stable in value, produce income for governance independent of crypto market volatility, offer transparency, and can potentially see use in developing a nascent “real-world assets” sector on Arbitrum chains.\n\nApplicants whose products meet certain quality thresholds will be presented to ARB holders and their delegates for possible asset allocation. All final asset allocation decisions rest with ARB holders and their representatives. This RFP is intended to both collect relevant information for the committee and also to recommend allocations for tokenholders to vote upon.\n\n**Requester background**\n\nArbitrum governance maintains and upgrades the Arbitrum technology stack, upon which are built multiple blockchains, including the largest Layer 2 on Ethereum, with more than $2.8b in assets onchain.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Asset information**\n\nThis program is intended to convert 35,000,000 ARB into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. The dollar notional amount of this investment is subject to market volatility, but at the time of February 9, 2024, is valued at approximately $66,000,000. These assets do not have a specific futured obligation or liability they are matched against. The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands legal entity, will be the transacting counterparty.\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe committee is comprised of 6 members including GFX Labs, Steakhouse Financial, Karpatkey, Nethermind, and North Lakes Legal. The Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group also serves as a non-voting member of the committee, except in the case of ties.\n\nAll members are required to recuse themselves for any application in which they have a monetary interest, direct or indirect.\n\nThe Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group leads this process, and answers to stakeholders within Arbitrum governance.\n\n**Scope of service/criteria**\n\nPlease include the following as part of your proposal:\nSample or template investment contract and the governing instrument (credit agreement, partnership agreement, etc.).\nInvestment selection, monitoring, and reporting plan.\nCompliance requirements.

    "description": "#  Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0\n**Summary:** This proposal proposes to allocate 125,000 $ARB tokens, equal to 0.00125% of the total supply, to recognize and reward the outstanding contributions of the Arbitrum community member known as \"Arbiter\". Arbiter receives the arbiter community role in the arbitrum discord after having made significant contributions to Arbitrum, as recognized by members of the Arbitrum team.\n\nOver the three-year period 2021-2023, these contributors played a key role in the development of Arbitrum, from translating, advising, publicizing, and docking projects to community support, fraud prevention, and docking activities etc. At the time of the Arbitrum DAO's inception, Arbiters did not receive any airdrops or rewards.\n\nBy establishing a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that arbiters did not keep proof of their contributions before and after the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO, and that a great deal of their work could not be counted or quantified, the dedication of each arbiter is also exceptionally valuable.\n\nAll members of arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal as a whole and agreed on an equal share of the reward amount.\n\n**Foreword:** 25 Arbiters come from different countries with different time zones, speak different languages. Arbiters have been deprecated by the Arbitrum team, and it has become extremely difficult to bring arbiters together. Arbiters who have made outstanding contributions to the Arbitrum community from 2021 to 2023. Compared to on-chain activists and ecosystem projects which have conducted a large number of airdrops, arbiters haven’t received any airdrop retroactive rewards\n\nConsidering the large number of contributions made by arbiters prior to the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO that have not been effectively preserved, and the fact that there are many members whose work cannot be counted and quantified, and that the dedication of each arbiter has been exceptionally valuable, all members of the arbiters have agreed that arbiters as a whole should initiate the proposal. All members of Arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal and apply for retroactive awards for Arbiters as a whole.\n\nArbiter as a whole (or project) is asking for retroactive rewards. If each member's contribution is listed one by one to make a forced comparison, this will bring arbiter infinite tug-of-war, mutual disputes, suspicion etc.. At the same time, Arbiter is not professional to establish a very systematic and perfect evaluation system.\n\nSpecial statement: As the earliest arbitrum contributor, arbiter is retroactively obtaining voting rights and voice in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. The Arbitrum DAO airdrop to early adopters and ecosystem projects also does not take price into account, but rather the weight of governance. The choice of 125,000 $ARB is fully considered (explained in detail below). If the current arb price is $0.1, the arbiter also only apply for 125,000 $ARB, which has little to do with price.\n\n**Motivation:** The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1.Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\n\n2.Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n\n3.Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n\n4.Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:** The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-empowering-early-contributors-the-community-arbiter-proposal-2-0/20404",

    "description": "# Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO\n# [](#constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum’s unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great.\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## [](#specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/yORl1yZPt7Q) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post “this proposal is now onchain (link)”, the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new>\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with* [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) *to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/WY1jQ2tP70U) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma’s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally’s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## [](#timeline-6)Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## [](#overall-cost-7)Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)&#x20;\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n*The price of ARB at the time of onchain proposal creation was used to determine the amount of ARB to include in the transactions in this proposal.*\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward* [@shawn16400](/u/shawn16400)\\*\\* [@hiringdevs.eth](/u/hiringdevs.eth) [@hung-vu](/u/hung-vu) [@cbxm](/u/cbxm)",

    "description": "# Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request\n## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n## **Background and Progress**\n\n[The Arbitrum grants 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/), administered via DDA by Questbook and 4 domain allocators, (Cattin, Adam, Juandi and JoJo) went live on the 5th of October with a total [grants budget of $800k 6](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook-arbitrum-dao-grants/14688) spread across four domains. Since the launch of the grants program, the Arbitrum domain allocators approved proposals requesting $912k and disbursed a total of ~$394,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 201 proposals. These domain allocators [**were elected from the community and by the community. 3**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-dao-grants-domain-allocator-nominations/15759/72) The specific information regarding the accepted proposals and the funded teams can be found [here 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/).\n\nAs previously stated in our initial proposal, Questbook launched the grants program to further scale it based on proposal volume and learnings from the first ever grants program in the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

The Price fluctuations of the Arb tokens in the program were of concern for the program, as the overall budget which was denominated in USD kept fluctuating through the term of the grant program. In order to avoid a price fluctuation like that, and based on the feedback received on the Questbook DDA program feedback call from the DAO and delegates, an option is to convert all the Arb received at the time of the proposal passing to Stable coins immediately, to avoid fluctuation.\n2. As many projects have not completed their milestones yet, and with the milestones not having a due date for completion, a problem we foresee is these funds if the projects do not complete them may be locked for ever, or for an indefinite amount of time. If the projects complete their proposals post the program time, there is no structure in place to have the DAs review them post completion and fund them, as the program would have ended by then. To avoid this, for the next program, fixed deadlines will be set for a grant, where either the proposal can be taken over by a seperate team, or the funds can be clawbacked and allocated to another proposal.\n3. Work hour restrictions for DAs was limiting their ability to maximise their impact on the program, as they were only allowed to deliver 60 hours of effort a month. Based on the program so far, we realise that a time restriction only inhibits the DA from their ability assess proposals and support them more deeply, and therefore are suggesting a fixed monthly pay for the work a DA and PM does instead of pay on an hourly basis.\n4. Some of the proposals or conversations projects had with Quesbtook could not be followed on with a funding due to the soft cap established on the program to start with. To tackle this issue, and with the Arbitrum foundation grant ranging from $50-250k, we believe the program should increase its cap to $50k to cover the gap and accept a wider number of proposals.\n5. While all feedbacks, changes and evaluation were timely reported in the Questbook platform, was nonetheless necessary for DA to engage with grantees through chatting systems like Telegram and Google meet. This has generated some questions from the community as a whole regarding inhomogeneous communications ways. We will address this by standardizing both the report frequency, the template used, and especially by setting up a shared discord between all domains. 1:1 calls between DAs and teams will still be needed.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\nDomainDomain AllocatorProposed BudgetNew Protocol IdeasJojo$920,000GamingAdam$920,000Dev ToolingJuandi$920,000Education, Growth, Community and EventsCattin (Seed Latam)$920,000\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1.

Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using [**Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1**](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/). Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N\\*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires **significant expertise and time commitment** from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from the previous program specified above, we believe that opting for a fixed payment structure over an hourly paid model may be more impactful for the program. DAs and PMs have months where the work goes above and beyond the work hours mentioned, which does not get compensated accordingly, and there are constraints to work hours and impact a DA can provide within the limited hours provided. This indeed also impacted the turnaround time, alongside some technical difficulties.\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\n\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nRoleMonthly CostTotalProgram Manager and Questbook$10000$60,000\\*Domain Allocator$8000$192,000Overhead for extra 6 months$8400$50,400Operations Cost, Misc.$10,000Totals:$312,400\n\n* Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse 1](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### KPIs and Expectations\n\n**Program Success**\n\n* Increase in the number of contributors, proposals, and funded projects\n* Increase in milestone and proposal completion rates\n* Increase in NPS score from all proposers and grantees\n* Lower response turn around time to delegates’ and community’s queries\n* Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community members to review the proposals across different domains during community calls regularly\n* Timely publishing of comprehensive monthly grants report, outlining the status, progress, and impact of the program, ensuring transparency and accountability\n\n**Enhanced Community Involvement**\n\n* Increase in community engagement across :\n  * Discourse\n  * Discord, Telegram\n  * Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n* Increase in the community members’ participation to keep domain allocators and program manager accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\n* Strengthened contributors’ sentiment and word of mouth towards Arbitrum measured through frequent sentiment surveys/ polls to gauge satisfaction\n* Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition and awareness within contributor circles through surveys or social media analytics, tracking mentions, reach etc.\n\n**Contribution of Funded Projects to Arbitrum**\n\n* Number of users onboarded by the funded proposals onto their app/protocol\n* TVL (if applicable) of the selected proposals\n* Number of new interfaces for supplying / borrowing / governance interactions\n* Number of projects that have raised follow on capital after getting a grant from Arbitrum Questbook program\n\n### **Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities**\n\n* All Domain Allocators and the Program Manager will continue to uphold their designated responsibilities as outlined in the Arbitrum DDA Program 1 proposal.\n* Domain allocators may request an audit for the considered/accepted proposals, particularly those that involve Solidity code being deployed into production and directly impacting Arbitrum with an high spending cap. In order to streamline the code auditing process and avoid potential time-consuming challenges, the domain allocators will provide assistance to the considered/accepted proposals by offering feedback on code quality and design.\n* As an addition to the previous iteration, projects will have to submit a proposed timeline for their project. The maximum time to complete the final milestone will be 1 year from the start of this iteration of the program (equivalent of 6 months after the natural end of it); after this date, all undistributed funds related to grant that did not complete their milestones will be given back to the Arbitrum DAO\n* The DAs, alongside the PM, will publish every 45 days in the Arbitrum governance forum a comprehensive report of the current status of the approved applications.\n* Every 2 weeks, the DAs will host a public office hour for protocols to come in and request information about any detail they might need to understand to apply to the grant program. This public call will also be used to provide general feedback on the ongoing program and will also let delegates and other stakeholders ask for information about it\n* Similar to the Arbitrum DDA program 1, the Program Manager will collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation team and the elected domain allocators to **create and list out necessary RFPs** in order to ensure alignment with Arbitrum’s priorities and roadmap.\n\n### **About Questbook**\n\n* Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being/previously used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero etc.\n* Considering the achievements of Arbitrum DDA program, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. Srijith from Questbook will keep his role with the responsibilities of the Program Manager.\n\n### Method for converting Arb to Stablecoins\n\nIn the process of converting Arb tokens to stablecoins, we are requesting for 30% additional Arb in notional USD terms to make sure that there are $4M in the multisig in the end of the process due to any price actions, and whatever is extra, will be returned back to the DAO post the conversion.\n\nIn addition, if there is an important downturn in the value of Arb from the beginning of the Tally vote towards the end which affects the value received in USD terms significantly, we would potentially putup a second vote to re-fund the leftover USD needed as per the original $4M request.\n\nQuestbook will work with Aera, in collaboration with Gauntlet, thanks [@Matt\\_Gauntlet](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_gauntlet) for your help with this collaboration.\n\nThe following description is from the Aera team on the process of converting the Arb received to stablecoins.\n\nAs part of their engagement with the DAO, Questbook will be leveraging Aera to diversify out of the ARB tokens into USDC. Aera has engaged with the DAO previously to create a detailed report on treasury management. This report spoke in-depth about execution dynamics for ARB and specifically around the onchain impact of small and large ARB liquidations, particularly that there was outsized market impact relative to the size of liquidations from having grantees in individuals selling ARB themselves. Aera introduces a concept of Protocol Owned Execution (PoE), where the DAO would own the execution out of the governance token via Aera to achieve better execution on the whole.\n\nIn the context of the Questbook proposal, the flow for using Aera looks like the following:\n\n[image1664×608 85 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551.png)\n\n!<https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551_2_690x252.png>\n\nTo clarify how this works:\n\nQuestbook multisig will be the owner of the Aera vault. This gives only the Questbook Multisig the ability to withdraw and deposit from the vault at any time, as well as select which assets can be held, and which DeFi protocols can be interacted with.\n\nThe Guardian of the Aera Vault will be Gauntlet. Gauntlet acting as a guardian submits rebalance transactions against the vault to sell ARB for USDC.\n\nExecution will be done in batches to prevent a outsized price impact. Furthermore, Aera has the ability to conduct operations under specific slippage requirements, if desired.\n\nThe Aera vault has hooks in place that prevent >3% loss per day due to guardian interactions, and it disallows interaction with anything not previously approved by the Owner (Questbook Multisig).\n\nQuestbook is looking to generate $4M in USDC from selling ARB. One risk here is that price fluctuations in ARB bring the initial ARB allocation below the needed $4M USDC notional. While there is fundamentally no way to mitigate this entirely (From Mar 13th - 19th the price of ARB dropped >30%), it is possible to hedge this by asking for a sufficient buffer. Given historical drawdowns a 30% additional ARB buffer (in notional USD terms) should be sufficient.\n\nFor this proposal of converting the Arb to stablecoins, Aera will be using Bebop as the primary exchange and Uniswap as a fallback. Bebop is an onchain exchange that taps into a solver network. Bebop is critical for this proposal due to its ability to tap into offchain liquidity (which is much deeper than onchain liquidity). In concept, Bebop is similar to CoWSwap in how it taps into an offchain network of solvers. Uniswap will also be enabled as part of the Aera vault, and will be used in a fallback capacity. Uniswap has the deepest onchain liquidity for ARB on Arbitrum, and we will use it as a fallback should Bebop have worse execution.\n\nOne important question is why Bebop and Uniswap and not other aggregators or exchanges. In many ways Bebop is an aggregator already, solvers filling orders on Bebop can tap into whatever onchain or offchain liquidity sources they want in order to fill an order. As such Aera doesn’t need to explicitly tap into alternative DEXes or Aggregators to fill orders.",

    "description": "# Double-Down on STIP Successes (STIP-Bridge)\n![]()**Abstract**![]()\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum’s market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. It serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. The STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\nAligning with Arbitrum’s mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n### **Eligibility**\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP or the Backfund is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n### **Maximum Funding Size:**\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n### **STIP Performance Audits**\n\nTo give the community a better understanding of how protocols utilized their STIP grants, audits will be conducted.\n\nOpenBlock Labs has been monitoring protocols included in STIP and reporting their data using [dashboards](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/grantees).\n\nOpenBlocks will be providing closing remarks on all protocols they have data for. These summaries will include:\n\n* The percentage of STIP allocation that recipients used\n* The amount of unused funds recipient protocols returned to the incentives multisig\n* Should be any remaining amount of full allocation\n* Success metrics compared to similar control protocols\n* Insights into oddities that occurred during the incentive period\n\nAdditional analysis opportunities:\n\nAdditionally, this proposal team has already asked the ARDC that once they are prepared to provide additional analysis and insights to prepare for LTIP.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity for Arbitrum community members to use the data that OpenBlocks has been sharing in their open-source dashboards to create their own analysis. Community-driven analysis of the success of STIP will bring many interpretations of the data and help delegates make the most informed decisions. This analysis could be compensated via a portion of the research bounty budget from LTIPP.\n\n### **Advisors Help**\n\nThe [advisors](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-regarding-our-role-instructions-for-applicants-and-open-questions-we-aim-to-answer/21297) from the LTIPP (JoJo, SeedLatam, Castel Capital) proved to be a tremendous help to applicants as they ensured protocols received quality feedback, a better understanding of how much ARB they should request, and possible incentive mechanisms to use. Additionally, the Advisors stay on to support the protocols during the program allowing each team to better learn and iterate through testing.\n\nThe LTIPP advisors have agreed to assist similarly during the STIP bridge. Protocols applying to the bridge will have the opportunity to meet with an advisor. This will help them gain insights into their proposals. This not only helps guide applicants through the process but also ensures the DAO will have better proposals to review.\n\nThe advisors will hold office hours during the Addendum period to help answer questions protocols have, and to discuss with them through the Discord infrastructure already leveraged during LTIPP, in a way they could provide feedback on both previous results and/or new mechanisms to integrate.\n\n\n\n### **Program Manager Role**\n\nThe STIP Bridge will include a program manager to help ensure the program runs smoothly. As seen in other programs, a single manager is required to ensure efficient and effective operations and to deal with the unexpected situations that ultimately appear.\n\nProject manager responsibilities:\n\n* Ensure Addendums are properly posted\n* Administer deadlines for various phases of the program\n* Handle COI with advisors\n* Help facilitate the posting of snapshots\n* Help coordinate with the multisig to ensure funds are properly distributed\n* Update grant recipients on program progress as streams start, run, and end\n\nMatt Stein from StableLab will serve as the program manager.\n\n### **How To Apply - Addendum on STIP Forum post:**\n\nAny STIP protocol wishing to apply will fill out the [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAfter filling out the Addendum, protocols will post it in the newly formed “STIP Bridge Addendum” section of the forum. These posts should be titled “\\[Protocol Name] STIP Addendum”\n\nApplicants will be able to meet with an advisor during office hours to get feedback regarding their incentive plan and grant amount as protocols did with LTIPP.\n\nApplicants will have around two weeks to submit their Addendums. Beginning when the Tally vote becomes active and ending when the tally vote ends.\n\nApplicants can edit their Addendums as many times as they want until the deadline. Once the Tally vote ends Addendums are final and can no longer be modified.\n\n### **Challenge and Review Period**\n\nDuring this time between the tally vote and the optimistic snapshots, delegates will have a week to review Addendums and prepare to post challenge snapshots for applicants they believe require a closer look.\n\nAny delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a challenge snapshot using this challenge [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Voting and Approval Mechanism:**\n\n#### **Optimistic Approach**\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO’s full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n#### **Initial Voting Mechanism**\n\nThe Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nShould this Tally vote pass, all STIP protocols that properly submitted an addendum will be optimistically awarded a grant\n\n#### **Challenge Snapshot Process**\n\nIf the DAO feels some applicants should not be optimistically funded and require a closer look, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated may post a challenge Snapshot for a specific applicant.\n\nIf a challenge snapshot is posted, that applicant must receive at least 66% of the votes in favor of funding (Excluding abstain votes) in order to receive their bridge funding.\n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did:\n\n* (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements,\n* (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or\n* (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications.\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Possibility of Extension**\n\nIn case the full long-term incentives program gets delayed, this proposal will have a built-in extension method to prevent another gap between incentive programs.\n\nIf 4 weeks before the end of STIP Bridge incentives distribution, another incentive program has not passed a snapshot, then we will post another extension directly to Tally that extends funds for protocols that received funds from LTIPP and/or STIP Bridge.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n* Send funds to LTIP multisig\n* Have applicants post Addendums\n* Conduct Performance audits\n* Have DAO members challenge contested proposals on the forum\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams along a similar timeline as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge around the same time as LTIPP.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2103876f-7f5f-463b-8d14-a648c24c0dc0_original.png)\n\n## **Overall Cost: 37.6M ARB**\n\n### **Incentives Budget: 37,500,000 ARB**\n\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\n### **Operational Cost: 100K ARB**\n\nA maximum of 100K ARB will be used for the operational budget. This could be used to cover the costs of the advisors, pm, multisig signers, additional audits, and or any other expenses that come up while operating the proposal. A separate snapshot will be published to allow the DAO to decide how these funds will be spent.\n\n# **Additional Documents:**\n\n* [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing) for protocols\n* [Delegate challenge template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing)",

    "description": "# GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)\n# [](#hack-humanity-govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels-1)Hack Humanity: GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)\n\n**non-constituional**\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nHack Humanity is seeking $309k of funding from the Arbitrum DAO to host an event and after-party coinciding with [ETH CC](https://ethcc.io/) in Brussels, Belgium. Arbitrum GovHack Brussels will take place as a 3-day event on July 5, 6, and 7, the days directly prior to the start of the conference. ETH CC is only 11 weeks away, so approving the funds ASAP is of the utmost importance to ensure that Arbitrum has a strong presence at one of the most important Ethereum-centric events of the year.\n\nHack Humanity intends to continue serving the DAO by planning IRL activations and will seek additional funding in the coming months. The time constraints for ETH CC have led us to propose funding solely for this event in hopes of an expedient proposal process prior to asking the DAO for a larger funding package that ensures a long-term and optimal solution for Arbitrum DAO’s event participation.\n\nGovHack Brussels aims to:\n\n* Build trust and deepen relationships between Arbitrum contributors\n* Ideate and later implement proposals that benefit Arbitrum\n* Attract new talent to the DAO\n* Position Arbitrum as the go-to home for talent to build and the DAO as a world-class operation maturing and innovating at the forefront of decentralized governance\n\nGovHack Brussels, improves on and expands GovHack ETHDenver with additional prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, enhancing and running a proper community showcase day, and adding a dedicated afterparty.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nIn a world of remote work, decentralized technology, and decentralized finance, the human social-layer needs intentional facilitation and development to mature and enable building this next paradigm of technology and new ways of working together. Online collaboration can only get us so far. A key competitive advantage for the ArbitrumDAO is strategically investing in growing a high-trust network of talented contributors, delegates, service providers, and builders on Arbitrum. GovHack ETHDenver proved the thesis that in-person opportunities for the DAO to work together represent a significant competitive advantage for Arbitrum.\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4fec995f9c5fa12ec06eacbfd88bd65104c776a9.jpeg)](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r)\n\nIf you are aiming to learn more about what GovHack aims to achieve, please check out their ETHDenver:\n\n* [Pitch](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r) deck\n* [Impact Report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239) - 9.1 star rating and 67% NPS from participants\n* [Media production](https://www.youtube.com/@HackHumanity/playlists)\n* Aftermovie:\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b1a008f0826ef178f0fe33e5b6bd4d4920622e8.jpeg \"GovHack Aftermovie - ETHDenver 2024 - Powered by Hack Humanity\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE)\n\nHack Humanity, was previously funded with a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to host GovHack ETHDenver. Hack Humanity is looking to build on this success and momentum as an ecosystem development partner through IRL activations with the Arbitrum DAO for the long-term.\n\nIt is critical that Arbitrum has a significant presence at industry-leading events, and that contributors have regular and consistent IRL opportunities to grow high-trust relationships. It builds community and brand while attracting users, developers, and other important DAO contributors.\n\nHack Humanity offers deep custom work pre-event; with ecosystem mapping, facilitating community co-design processes to develop tracks & challenge statements most relevant to Arbitrum, identifying target talent contributor personas, skill gap analysis of who to market and recruit to the ecosystem. Hack Humanity drives innovation through unique custom IRL experiences that mature and evolve the DAO’s capabilities.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055_2_599x341.jpeg)\n\n1600×912 352 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055.jpeg)\n\nA well-run event typically requires a minimum of 3 months of lead time, with factors such as securing suppliers, the team’s calendar, and venue down payments requiring capital upfront from the event organizer. We are less than 90 days out from ETH CC, and at this point Arbitrum is not well-positioned to have a strong presence in Brussels. [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave) (Hack Humanity founder) has exemplified his ability to host high-quality IRL activations on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO in the past, so we believe that getting funds approved ASAP so that Hack Humanity can begin organizing a governance hackathon and an after-party is very important.\n\nRelevant Hack Humanity resources:\n\n* [Arbitrum GovHack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE) Video (ETHDenver)\n  * GovHack ETH Denver [forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-powered-by-hack-humanity/21119) proposal\n  * [Impact report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239)\n* [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave/)’ work at [IBM](https://youtu.be/cMMkxZo89GQ)\n* Company [Website](https://www.hackhumanity.com/)\n  * [Hack Humanity Pitch Deck](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dqxabsyasoohpa4cyqh4y/Hack-Humanity-Human-Centred-Hackathons-v2024.pdf?rlkey=r0brje5hzkq8sxwryje6gbpc2\\&dl=0)\n* YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hackhumanity)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackHumanityCo)\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThe most successful crypto brands, such as Uniswap, LayerZero, dYdX, and others, prioritize brand presence at events to reaffirm their positions as industry leaders. ETH CC is an Ethereum-focused event, and Arbitrum should lean into that given its status as the leading Ethereum L2. These events provide substantial value, such as brand strengthening, community building, attracting developer talent, in-person ideation, and more.\n\nMany hackathons cost north of $1M with smart contract base layers like Near, zkSync, Avalanche, and others throwing events/hackathons with more than 1000 participants. It’s important Arbitrum remains competitive with these other protocols to ensure its ability to attract talent.\n\n## [](#specifications-5)Specifications\n\nGovHack will run for three days, boast a prize pool of $20k for GovHack participants, have t-shirts and other swag for attendees to get their hands on, and pre, mid, and post-event media production and storytelling to represent the voice of the DAO and to amplify the event on social platforms.\n\nGovHack is 3 events in 1: A 2-day hackathon-style bootcamp, followed by a 1-day Community Showcase, followed by an afterparty. Hack Humanity is looking to build on GovHack ETHDenver’s success and coevolve with the DAO over the long term.\n\n**For GovHack Brussels a full impact report and transparency around the event and its cost will be posted in the forum following its completion.**\n\n## [](#steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\nOnce spending is approved by the DAO, funds will be sent to a ⅔ multisig to be converted into dollars. These dollars will be used to pay for the costs associated with running and organizing the event. Hack Humanity will provide event details on the forum so that the entire community can participate in the event’s scope and execution.\n\n50% of the funds will be paid to Hack Humanity upon this proposal’s approval. An additional 35% will be disbursed the week before the event, and the final 15% will be disbursed after the event concludes.\n\nThe 3 multisig signers will be: Klaus + Abdullah Umar (Arana Digital) + Krzysztof Urbański\nThe multisig address is (arb1) 0x03D47B06Cc95bAFf2a408cD7c735ed7e7142Edb9\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n## [](#timeline-7)Timeline\n\nThe event will take place July 5, 6, and 7 (2024) in Brussels, Belgium directly before ETH CC. Given the strict timeline, we are hoping to proceed to Snapshot on Wednesday, April 24th (if delegates approve), in order to hopefully have funds earmarked by the end of May.\n\nMore details will be shared with the DAO in the weeks leading up to the event surrounding the specifics of GovHack.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008_2_187x465.png)\n\n502×1246 40 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008.png)\n\nWith the expedited process as outlined, Hack Humanity will only have a ~5 week buffer to plan the event. It is paramount that if the DAO wants representation at ETH CC, we move with haste.\n\n## [](#overall-cost-8)Overall Cost\n\nBrussels is an expensive European city, and successfully executing a world-class high-quality IRL activation requires a significant budget.\n\nThe event’s research, preparation and delivery phase determines the exact event program design, local costs, the number of participants, any scholarships/stipends, etc. Getting the funds approved is the top priority so that Hack Humanity can begin to work out these details.\n\nThe all-in cost to execute this proposal is expected to be $309k, with a rough budget broken down in the following table:\n\nItem\n\nCost\n\nVenue, Food, Drink, Swag, room equipment, interior decor, printing, stationery\n\n$85,000\n\nMarketing, targeted contributor outreach, Pre/Post Event Media Production, AV equipment rental, hackathon management software and other licensing\n\n$33,000\n\nHackathon Prize Pool\n\n$20,000\n\nScholarships\n\n$10,000\n\nAfter-party + Contingency\n\n$50,000\n\nOn-site living costs (5 days, lead in, lead out day + 3 delivery days for a team of 7): Flights, Accommodation, Ubers, Food\n\n$13,000\n\nHack Humanity margin and fees. GovHack Director and assistant to design, organize, deliver the event. Designer, local Brussels event producer advisory, on-site GovHack delivery team (7). Post-event Impact Report, community engagement, handover.\n\n$98,000\n\n**Total Cost**:\n\n**$309,000**\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\nThe amount of ARB to be moved to the multisig will be determined in accordance with the dollar equivalent of the trailing 14D ARB TWAP with a 30% buffer. **After the ARB is swapped to USDC, any amount in excess of $309k will be immediately back to the DAO.**\n\nThe scope of this proposal to the DAO is specifically for ETH CC in Brussels. Hack Humanity intends to produce a subsequent proposal to provide a year-round program of events on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO, this will require a larger funding package, with a component to cover a full-time team & and a component for an event budget to cover a series of IRL events. Hack Humanity needs the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated team committed to Arbitrum, this uniquely enables high-context, up to date and relevant continual program design in lockstep with the needs of Arbitrum’s roadmap and community needs, it also enables Hack Humanity and team to commit and block calendar dates for future events 6-12 months in advance, secure venues, and team member’s time. This requires upfront funding.\n\nExpect another proposal for further funding in the coming months. We need this GovHack Brussels proposal to be executed swiftly so that the event in Brussels can be organized as soon as possible, hence our decision to seek funding only for this event rather than trying to pass a larger DAO spend.",

The source of these tokens are from early personal investment into Arbitrum.\n\n**Grant Breakdown**\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a deeply liquid borrowing and lending market for ARB tokens. The funds matched by the Arbitrum DAO will be used exclusively to bootstrap the supply side in the two ARB markets. The funds from Micheal Egorov are used for the crvUSD/ARB/CRV pool and upcoming LRT/WETH AMM pools. Possible LRT tokens are weETH (ether.fi), ezETH (Renzo) and reETH (KelpDAO), which have decent liquidity on arbitrum.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 8.36.34 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihn7esgqmy7jaqqz7bfkrdgsrsgsvqpf4do4253ojjvz26gjl4ct4)\n\nThe ARB will be deployed to the market/pool rewards as a supply incentive and direct LP incentive.\n\nOnce funds have been received, we will work with the Curve core team to deploy the grant. Distribution will begin shortly after the necessary markets have been deployed.\n\n\n\n**Note added, 9. May 2024**\n\nCurve’s matching contribution of 237,500 donated by Michael Egorov has partly already commenced, to this date, 168’000 ARB has being distributed directly in the following lending markets: ARB/crvUSD, WETH/crvUSD, WBTC/crvUSD, CRV/crvUSD. They helped to bootstramp curve lending.\n\nUpon successful passing of this vote, the remaining, 69,500 ARB undistributed funds will be deposited into the multisig.\n\nDuring the incentive, Michael Egorov will add his monthly vested 19,791 ARB on top of the pledged 237,500 ARB.\n\nLlamaRisk will coordinate with LTIPP council to ensure any data reporting requirements and compliance requirements of LTIPP are followed\n\n\n\n**Link to Full Proposal below**\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-request-to-match-my-donation-to-boostrap-curve-lending-on-arbitrum/22975",

    "description": "# Pilot Phase: M&A for Arbitrum DAO\nNon-constitutional\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pilot-phase-m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23588>\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe 8-weeks M\\&A pilot phase proposal is the next step toward the Arbitrum M\\&A proposal outlining the opportunity for Arbitrum DAO to form an M\\&A Unit focused on identifying and executing on acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe overarching aim is to utilize M\\&A as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem and to help the DAO expand non-organically through acquisition opportunities that are not accessible to competing ecosystems, thereby critically enhancing Arbitrum DAO's capital allocation methods.\n\nFull details on the M\\&A proposal, its operational processes and structure you can find in the [Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205 \"Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal\")\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 8-week pilot phase is designed to provide the DAO with sufficient information to make an informed go/no-go decision regarding the further operationalization of the M\\&A unit and its funding requirements. It is the natural progression of a 6 weeks Working Group sprint to develop an initial structure of the M\\&A unit.\n\nIn addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M\\&A, analyzing strategic target areas, aligning them with key stakeholders (both online and at the GovHack in Brussels), and providing exemplary analyses on targets, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe dedicated goals of the pilot phase are the following:\n\n1. **Equip the DAO with sufficient knowledge** to make an informed decision about the operationalization of the fund.\n2. **Align the DAO on strategic target areas** by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key delegates and stakeholders.\n3. **Provide an orchestrated platform for discussion** of the efforts over an extended period of time to further sharpen the edges.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe initiative will be led by a dedicated team from Areta - the leading independent crypto-native investment bank specializing in M\\&A and complex financial transactions for some of the leading ecosystems in the crypto space with deep M\\&A transaction expertise and involvement in Arbitrum DAO.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO. Further, the GovHack at EthCC will be used for status update and facilitation of a working session. The insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO, incl.:\n\n**1. Analysis of M\\&A value upside for Arbitrum DAO**\n\n* Arbitrum M\\&A value upside analysis, incl. benchmarking for the DAO\n* Assessment of tactical importance of M\\&A for the DAO, incl. activities that M\\&A will enable the DAO to engage in\n* Impact analyses of determined target areas\n\n**2. Development of strategic areas for Arbitrum DAO supported by in-depth analyses, incl. alignment of target areas with key stakeholders in the DAO**\n\n* In-depth strategic analyses of target areas, incl. financial and strategic upside to the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Facilitating interactions across the DAO to present results of analyses and align stakeholders. Key part of these will be held at the GovHack in EthCC.\n\n**3. Analyses of target examples and presentation to the DAO**\n\n* Exemplary target identification on one target area to provide the DAO with a better understanding of what it would mean to have the M\\&A Mgmt Unit operate\n* Target analysis and example of outside-in due diligence process\n* Integration options per target in context of Arbitrum DAO\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe pilot phase (as detailed in the proposal) will entail an 8-week sprint structured into 3 work packages and underlying deliverables detailed out above.\n\n## **Overall Cost**\n\nOverall cost for the 8-weeks pilot phase will be $52k ARB, consisting of:\n\n* **Operational budget:** Minimal budget to cover cost for a lean team conducting the execution of outlined work packages: $25k ARB / month\n* **Access to Data Providers/Research Platforms:** $2k in ARB (remaining budget to be refunded to the DAO)\n\nReceiving wallet address: 0xd5c4E8dd598205045f406DC81b9e01E91005C912\n\nSafe MSig with 3 signers: Bernard Schmid (0x8F7A73A6e96fAb2C970bC4b76d236c3dCCD6e7Da); Karl-Martin (0xC6Dc0805c3e7cF1667f80F46bd9D5b1443280dBF); Jan-Philip Grabs (0x39B91ede1F2e7524207cDFB6823Be2a4f9B94012)\n\n## Helpful links:\n\n* M\\&A Core Proposal: [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205)\n* M\\&A Working Group Progress: [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520)\n* M\\&A Telegram Group: [here](https://t.me/+IjizbmkcAisyZTli)\n* Easy-to-digest Video Summary (s/o to Sinkas): [here](https://twitter.com/Sinkas_/status/1784876301826073036)\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDefinitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the Arbitrum community, and/or industry-specific. This section is optional, but recommended.\n\n**Mergers & Acquisitions (M\\&A)**\n\nMergers and Acquisitions (M\\&A) involve the process of combining two companies into one or one company taking ownership of another. These transactions aim to create a more efficient and effective entity by leveraging synergies\n\n**Target**\n\nA target in M\\&A refers to the company that is being pursued for acquisition by another company, known as the acquirer. The acquisition typically results in a change of control of the target company, transferring ownership to the acquiring company.\n\n*Special thanks to @jacobpphillips and @hiringdevs.eth for sparking the initiative at the GovHack in Denver, and the WG members for their continuous support.*",

    "description": "# Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime\n## [](#non-constitutional-aip-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime-1)**\\[Non-Constitutional AIP] Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime**\n\n### [](#abstract-2)**Abstract**\n\n[WakeUp Labs](http://www.wakeuplabs.io) proposal outlines the development of a simple but effective front-end interface that enables users to force-include transactions directly on L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer is down, aiming to increase trust among end-users navigating the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nInspired by a few community discussions ([Link 1](https://x.com/Cattin0x/status/1735779772054077917?s=20) & [Link 2](https://x.com/fede_intern/status/1754226077981893052?s=20)) , and validated historical events like: [Sequencer Downtime 1](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), [Sequener Downtime 2](https://dedaub.com/blog/arbitrum-sequencer-outage), [Historical Sequencer Status](https://status.arbitrum.io/history/3) and [L2BEAT status](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk).\nThis tool aims to empower users with the ability to bypass the Sequencer in situations where it is unavailable or censoring transactions, thus aligning with Arbitrum’s vision for progressive decentralization.\n\nWakeUp Labs has a proven track record of expertise in crafting exceptional blockchain tools and infrastructure. Their contributions extend to collaborating on [open-source projects for major DAOs](https://x.com/0xMilton/status/1755972182553899487?s=20), enhancing Ethereum Foundation-funded initiatives, building complex DeFi protocols, SmartContracts and offering a [developer platform](http://www.platform.wakeuplabs.io) that facilitates robust and scalable API calls for smart contract deployment without requiring Solidity programming skills. (Currently operating even on the Arbitrum blockchain).\n\n### [](#introduction-3)**Introduction**\n\nThe Arbitrum Sequencer is a critical component of the network, responsible for submitting users’ transactions to L1.\n\nUnder the current system, the Sequencer is a potential single point of failure; if compromised, it could delay or prevent the processing of transactions.\n\nThere are ways to bypass it, but non-developer users lack that capability.\n\nThis proposal seeks to mitigate such risks by providing a user-friendly alternative transaction submission pathway, thereby enhancing the network’s resilience, user autonomy, and their confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFor the service to be truly useful in the event of catastrophic occurrences, empowering more teams to deploy their own instances is crucial. Thus, to boost the project’s reliability and significantly enhance its value to the Arbitrum DAO, it is essential to embrace an OpenSource approach from the beginning.\n\n### [](#rationale-4)**Rationale**\n\n* **Decentralization and user empowerment:** By enabling direct L1 transaction submissions, users can circumvent Sequencer outages or censorship, maintaining their ability to transact without interruption. This capability is crucial for ensuring the network’s operational integrity and aligns with the principle of progressive decentralization.\n* **Enhancing trustless security:** The proposed interface would serve as a valuable tool in rare situations where the Sequencer fails to perform its duties. It ensures that the Arbitrum Rollup maintains its trustless security model, even when permissioned components of the system are not functioning correctly.\n\n### [](#wakeup-labs-core-team-5)**WakeUp Labs core team**\n\n* [Milton Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/), co-founder and CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n* [Maximiliano del Hoyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/), co-founder and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project’s goals.\n* [Gonzalo Silman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/), co-founder and COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target audience.\n\n### [](#proposal-details-6)**Proposal Details**\n\n### [](#technical-implementation-7)Technical Implementation\n\n1. **OpenSource from Day One**: Given that the project should be 100% trustless, as clearly outlined in its ‘Rationale’ above, we believe that the entire project, including both the Back-End and Front-End, should be OpenSource from the beginning. One of our goals is for this service to be run from different instances and by different providers; therefore, it will be a top priority to ensure that this repository is well-documented and our support is readily available so that any team or community project can implement it.\n2. **Transaction Monitoring:** Develop functionality to listen for user transactions on L2 that are not included by the Sequencer, with guidance from the Arbitrum SDK documentation.\n3. **Manual Transaction Hash Input:** In cases where automatic detection is not feasible, provide a user interface for manually entering the transaction hash or implement manually the previous transaction in the new solution.\n   * *Step 2 and 3 might not be resolved as outlined in the proposal due to Arbitrum’s specific traits. However, a solution will be proposed and explained in both the technical documentation and the research document from milestone 1.*\n4. **L1 Transaction Replication:** Implement mechanisms to replicate the intended L2 transaction on L1, using “Forced Withdrawal” type transactions to push the L2 transaction from L1.\n5. **Confirmation Display:** Ensure the interface provides feedback once the transaction has successfully been processed.\n6. **Processing Time Consideration:** Account for the approximately 24-hour processing period to prevent errors or transaction duplication across chains.\n7. **Hosting, Service & Maintenance:** WakeUp will host the service, ensuring it runs 24/7, even on IPFS. For the first three months, we will fine-tune and iterate the service. Additionally, should any problems occur, the WakeUp team is committed to identifying and resolving these issues for a minimum of the next two years.\n\n### [](#development-roadmap-budget-allocation-8)Development Roadmap & Budget Allocation:\n\n1. **Technical Research, POC, Documentation and Testing (4 weeks, $ARB 9000):**\n   Deep dive into the Delayed Inbox functionality and its integration, along with creating a PoC and validating the necessity of a new internal tool for transaction monitoring and sequencer status. We will also carefully check that our solution doesn’t disrupt the proper functioning of Arbitrum; if it does, we will enable this instance only when the official sequencer is not operating correctly. This research conducted by the WakeUp Team will be made public, and the community will be able to view it, both in a summary Twitter Thread and in an Article shared on the OSS Github repository once completed.\n   This document will also consider the security measures that must be taken into account when carrying out the development.\n2. **Endpoint Development (1.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Creation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.\n3. **Logic Integration and Testing (2.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Connecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.\n4. **Design Phase (4 weeks, $ARB 5000):**\n   Additional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n5. **UI Development (3 weeks, $ARB 5500):**\n   Crafting an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs.\n   To enhance user security, we will add a banner at the top of the website to ensure the URL is correct and guard against phishing sites.\n6. **Enhancing Documentation Clarity and Usability (3 weeks, $ARB 6000):**\n   Finalizing and clearly documenting the open-source codebase. As detailed above, any team should be able to run their own instance of the service, so it’s crucial that everything is sufficiently clear. There, we will also add a list of URLs for instances set up by others that we can confirm are correctly implemented.\n   * *This process will not be linear. Since the project will be OpenSource from the beginning, it may not be sufficiently organized until milestone 6 is reached. This is why significant community contributions, like PRs or entirely new pieces of code, will be more practical after this milestone is completed.*\n7. **Service & Maintenance after Launch (24 months, $ARB 10000).**\n   We commit to hosting the site on Vercel or AWS, ensuring 24/7 operation for at least 24 months. Once a stable version has been achieved and properly tested, an instance will also be running on IPFS to ensure a 100% decentralized option. While this may not be the most performant option, it will be available for at least these 2 years. After evaluating its performance, we will attempt to provide it indefinitely. Initially, the WakeUp team will refine the website based on feedback from users and the Arbitrum community and will conduct continuous testing to ensure its reliability. Any issues, such as downtime or crashes, will be promptly addressed by the WakeUp team for at least the next two years.\n\n### [](#budget-resources-and-payment-schedule-9)**Budget, Resources and Payment Schedule**\n\n* **Estimated Timeframe:** Approximately 4.5 months for full implementation, including design phases; followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations and 24 months of hosting, monitoring, and bug fixing to address any possible error.\n* **Development Team:** One full-time senior Solidity developer for the core implementation and research, in coordination with the entire WakeUp Labs engineering team, plus additional design and developer resources for the UI/UX phase. The proposal also includes a Senior Developer working part-time for post-launch maintenance.\n  Gonzalo or Milton from the core team will also keep track of the project as PO.\n* **Payment Schedule & Terms:**\n  * A payment of 20% of the total grant required will be made on June 1st, as a *“Kick off payment”*.\n  * The remainder of the grant will be vested gradually, on a second-by-second basis, until approximately September (Over 4 months after the kickoff).\n  * The security council / The Arbitrum Foundation reserves the right to revoke the payment stream at any moment, to be used in case of unsatisfactory performance.\n* **Total Cost:** 42.500 $ARB\n\n### [](#conclusion-10)**Conclusion**\n\n### [](#h-11)\n\nDeveloping a front-end interface to enable force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial requirement in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring transaction capabilities even when the Sequencer is unavailable. By doing so, it aligns with Arbitrum’s goals of decentralization and enhancing user autonomy.\n\nFor the solution to be truly useful in critical cases, we must ensure that other projects can run their own instances of this service. This is why the project is conceived as OpenSource from the very beginning, and the WakeUp Labs team will actively assist teams wanting to implement it.\n\nFurthermore, WakeUp will be responsible for maintaining the service operational and implementing minor improvements for a minimum of 2 years.\n\n#### [](#notes-12)Notes:\n\nSome changes have been made throughout the proposal; you can see the details here: [Tally: Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247/46) [Proposals\n](/c/proposals/7)\n\nOpenZeppelin did a security analysis of this proposal here: <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-analysis-of-using-hedgey-for-proposal-payment-vesting/23780>",

    "description": "# Catalyze Gaming Ecosystem Growth on Arbitrum\nThis proposal was completed after a successful [Snapshot 8](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a9f2097b0b5a0021628e9edb0e7c9bffae4fdbb104f9996463e40a3129c7718) temp check for the Arbitrum DAO to empower gaming with a three year, 200m ARB with the goal of powering the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem with the best studios and games in the web3 industry.\n\nThe temp check showcased the enthusiasm to support web3 gaming, but also revealed important questions to answer when launching an ambitious, multi-year plan requiring not only a strong team to run the program, but transparent, flexible collaboration between many stakeholders.\n\n# Introduction - Gaming Catalyst Program\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is designed to immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by builders and players in the Gaming community.\n\nArbitrum has emerged as a leader in the competitive network race through a dynamic formula of innovation, robust technology, organic builders, and a variety of short and long-term incentives.\n\nThe proliferation of DeFi on Arbitrum showcases how quickly a snowball effect can onboard builders, users, and ultimately value for the Arbitrum DAO and other stakeholders (i.e. Offchain Labs, Ethereum, etc.). The TAM for DEFI has surged to $50B and is projected to surge to over $120B by 2030 and Arbitrum is leading the way.\n\nWe believe that the same opportunity exists to attract the best builders that will in turn create sticky high quality games that bring and retain new users within Arbitrum. The gaming vertical has a $250B TAM today that is projected to grow to $500B+ by 2030. Though the “web 3 + games” segment of today’s game TAM is relatively small, it is poised to grow exponentially this decade.\n\nSeveral L1s and L2s see this opportunity (most notably Solana, Cardano, Opstack, Immutable, Optimism, to name a few) and are moving to claim the builders with grants and investments.\n\n# GCP Hypothesis\n\nWhat changed: Minor language updates\n\nArbitrum has had immense success in the decentralized finance vertical, but the branding of Arbitrum as a home for gamers and game builders is nascent. As a network, Arbitrum falls behind major competitors (Immutable X, Ronin, Solana, etc) across total games migrated, games launched, and total gamers.\n\n[This educational post ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-and-the-future-of-web3-gaming/21270)shares some of the pain points and metrics within the gaming ecosystem in regards to Arbitrum.\n\nThrough the Gaming Catalyst Program, we aim to establish a dedicated team and fund to provide technical and strategic support to the game industry. This dedicated team is key to attracting and retaining the best established and independent developers.\n\nWe will know we are succeeding when we achieve the following:\n\n## Rapidly Increase the number of Game Developers using Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus\n\nThe GCP aims to provide support and resources to developers interested in building on the Arbitrum network. This includes access to funding, mentorship by vetted experts, and other forms of assistance to expedite the development process and contribute to success in the market post-launch.\n\n## Strategic Allocation of Resources via Grants and Investments\n\nBy allocating resources strategically, the program can maximize its impact by focusing on proven publishers and developers as well as promising independent projects within gaming. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively to foster the growth of high-quality games on Arbitrum.\n\n## Attracting and retaining Top Talent\n\nJust as DeFi projects have flocked to Arbitrum due to its innovative technology and incentives, the GCP aims to attract the best game developers in the industry. By offering support,incentives and game industry specific tools, Arbitrum can position itself as an attractive platform for game development, leading to a surge in high-quality gaming experiences on the network.\n\n## Expanding the Use Cases of Arbitrum\n\nWhile DeFi has been a major focus of Arbitrum’s success so far, expanding into the gaming vertical opens up new opportunities and use cases for the network. By supporting game and gaming infrastructure development, Arbitrum can diversify its ecosystem and appeal to a broader range of users and developers, with results that include but are not limited to Orbit chain and Stylus adoption.\n\n## Facilitating the Development of Sticky, Quality Games\n\nThe ultimate goal of the GCP is to encourage the development of sticky, high-quality games that not only attract users but also retain them over the long term. A dedicated GCP Team and Council representing the interests of the DAO will serve as quality control mechanisms to make sure the best applicants receive the full support of the GCP.\n\n# Proposal Summary\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWe are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a three year period to expand the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to use its learnings to mature the organization into a longer-term gaming program with a comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\n\nStrategically, we believe that attracting, retaining, and supporting builders with a dedicated team and an ongoing investment in game developers and the technical solutions they need will be a key differentiating factor vs other competitive networks. This commitment to gaming will lead to high quality game launches that will in turn attract large numbers of engaged gamers.\n\nPart of the fund will be utilized to co-invest into promising studios and games along with approved, Arbitrum-aligned publishers, with the belief that the business model, industry expertise, and track record of publishers will streamline the outreach, vetting, negotiation, onboarding, and support process for builders. The fund will also be available for all other game builders seeking to create games on Arbitrum.\n\n### Controls\n\nPublishers and developers will be subject to a robust set of checks and balances to ensure alignment with this proposal’s goals and Arbitrum DAO’s values:\n\n* A GCP Council of 5 individuals with deep gaming, venture experience, analytics / reporting, and/or DAO governance skills will be elected by the DAO and will be responsible for holding the Catalyst GCP Team accountable - with influence including general oversight, visibility of performance reviews for GCP team members, offering a channel for constructive feedback.\\*\\*\n* A GCP Team will be created with the support of the Arbitrum Foundation, and will collaborate with the GCP Council (which will serve as oversight):\n  * An investment committee of 3 individuals including 1 Council member will approve investments\n  * Funding for projects will be contingent on achieving milestones\n  * A quarterly transparency report will be created with summary data on GCP performance\n  * Funding of projects will include terms that are market competitive\n* Program Outcomes and KPIs\n\nWhat changed: Adjusted KPIs for year 1 and year 2 to account for infrastructure setup time\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst program has an overarching goal to bring in talented builders, and help the builders accelerate their games through the lifecycle stages.\n\nThe highest level metric we will be tracking is studio / builder onboarding into the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, there will be a variance in the realized outcome due to publisher applications, types of builders targeted, and variables from network competition.\n\nPrimary expected outcome:\n\nWithin the initial time frame of the program (3 years), the goal is to establish Arbitrum as a de facto leader for on-chain gaming. Specifically:\n\n* 400-600 applications\n* 100-200 net funded games\n* Win net migrations to Arbitrum vs other L2s\n* 50+ new Orbit launches\n\nThe GCP will take time to reach its full potential, and setting milestones vs maturity of the program is prudent:\n\nKPIYear 1Year 2Year 3Daily Active Users20,00050,000To be set by GCP TeamOrbit Launches520To be set by GCP TeamStudio Deals1020To be set by GCP Team\n\n*Most games will be in dev and not (yet) live in 2024*\n\nThe GCP team will set appropriate OKRs and KPIs internally to align with the goals and milestones listed above.\n\nAn additional outcome that the program aims to achieve is incremental movement through the gaming lifecycles illustrated by the Helika presentation on 2/2/24 [here (slide 15)](https://docsend.com/view/ktydpd3etn2iq2gv) during our open office hours.\n\n# Initiatives & Budgeting\n\nWhat changed: Formatting changes, combined sections for readability\n\nWe are asking the DAO for 200m ARB to develop the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe funding will be allocated towards the following initiatives over the span of a three year period:\n\n## 1. Builder Onboarding & Growth (160m ARB)\n\nFocused on attracting and supporting the best game builders into Arbitrum - open to publishers, established studios, and independent builders.\n\nUse of Funds: This funding is proposed to be reserved for established publishers, game studios and independent builders on Arbitrum to help scale the DAO’s ability to attract, secure, and accelerate talented teams on Arbitrum.\n\nThesis / Experiment: We are allocating a large majority of the budget to empower growth of publishers and studios on Arbitrum.\n\n### Build Grants (25m)\n\nGrants will primarily be used to empower teams that are aiming to accelerate early stage development on Arbitrum, or to incentivize user onboarding. Other grant uses may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Teams may apply via the GCP Grants form\n* Grants have a maximum size of 500k ARB\n* Preference for user onboarding incentives or early stage development\n* The grants manager has final approval on grants\n  * Scorecards and details must be shared with the GCP Council\n* Proposed: early grants period until legal entity is formed for GCP\n  * Onboard interim grants allocator\n  * Interim council of 5 members votes on individual grants\n  * Maximum allocation of 10m ARB prior to GCP entity formation\n* Each grant must have specific milestones agreed upon before funding\n\n### Investments (135m)\n\nTeams seeking more than 500k ARB or additional funding for development beyond initial development must work with the GCP investment team to align on deal terms.\n\nPublishers may submit multi-game deals to the GCP for consideration - allowing them to be more efficient and create more strategic plans for their ecosystem. As a packaged proposal, publishers and the GCP team may collaborate to set milestones, funding, kpis, etc in aggregate form or by each game, allowing for more flexible launch, development, and operational capabilities.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Builders or publishers must agree on a commercial agreement value share through tokens, equity, revenue share (post recoupment), or other pathways.\n  * Other considerations include active use of Orbit chains with significant sequencer revenue share as part of the default licensing structure\n* More detailed deal structure guidelines will be created by the GCP Team upon its formation\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n## 2. Infrastructure Bounties (40m ARB)\n\nFocused on creating game specific tech needed to make Arbitrum the best choice for game builders. Deals will follow grant or investment classifications based on the same sizing requirements as the Builder Onboarding and Growth program.\n\n* Allocated by RFP or decided by the Council on a per proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. account abstraction solutions and gasless transactions for games, payment rails, web and game engine SDKs, data analytics and attribution, etc.)\n* Promote Orbit, Stylus, and other development and infrastructure growth on top of new Arbitrum technology releases\n\nUse of Funds: This will be allocated by RFP or per proposal for any tooling and infrastructure needed to further support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. onboarding documentation, gaming-centric boilerplates for Arbitrum Orbit, game contract libraries built via Stylus, account abstraction and gasless transactions solutions, payment rails for games, web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot), etc.)\n\nThesis / Experiment: Web3 gaming is still nascent and there exists key gaps for game builders to build games and bring them to market. By incentivizing development for such infrastructure projects and tools, or accelerating development of Stylus as an Arbitrum native framework, this will help set Arbitrum further ahead in the competitive network landscape.\n\nCurrent Gaps: A non-exhaustive list of gaps that currently exist within the Arbitrum ecosystem:\n\n* Custom gaming-centric implementations of Orbit chains\n* Mobile App Infrastructure with wallet that is optimized for games and asset management (See Ronin Wallet on mobile as an example)\n* Web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot) that allow for in-game contract calls\n* Desktop launcher and distribution solutions\n* Game analytics, optimization, and related tooling (tying together on-chain, off-chain, social, and player activity)\n\nFunding Guidelines:\n\n* The GCP Team will establish initial RFPs and funding guidelines\n* An infrastructure specific rubric will be established by the Council to assess proposals\n* Independent proposals that do not fit within RFP guidelines are welcome to apply separately for GCP Team consideration\n* Any approved applicants for RFPs may be selected for vendor whitelisting, which allows vendors to be marketed to GCP participants\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n# GCP Org Structure\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWhen designing the organizational structure of the GCP, two major dynamics were considered:\n\n1. Enabling autonomy of the GCP team while setting safeguards for program success\n2. Empowering the DAO to have transparency and representation without impacting compliance, disclosure, and other necessities for a grants program with commercial ties within the gaming industry\n\n# <img height=\"317\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/32aa04e5451d1ed33e09b4a6dd9a51620cc5ba14.png\" />\n\n## Decision making process\n\n* Decision is made by GCP team\n  * Investment committee decision, staffing, etc\n* Council meetings every two weeks to discuss / veto any decisions\n* Decision is ‘ratified’ and activated\n* Every half year, aggregate summary of data as applicable shared in a report to DAO\n\n# GCP Team\n\nWhat changed: Added roles / responsibilities, section on entity setup, team incentives, and overall costing estimates.\n\nThe GCP Team will be the primary operator of the GCP program.\n\nTeam members may join the program through a few pathways:\n\n* Nomination through the proposal process (to help accelerate standup of the program)\n* Hiring by the GCP team, with veto capabilities held by the Council\n\nThe below team roles and responsibilities are illustrative of an initial proposed structure, but may change based on industry / program demands.\n\n## GCP Team Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThese roles are understood to be the MVP in order to stand up successful programming. The roles and titles may adjust based on needs. Any adjustment of budget will be reviewed with the council and put forth for the DAO to vote if needed.\n\n1.

Any expenditures above the $25m cap must be approved by the GCP council and may either be deducted from grant budgeting or increased through a DAO vote.\n\nPerformance against budget will be reviewed by GCP Council as part of the regular transparency reports.\n\nARB will be converted to USD or USDC by the Foundation before each quarter and sent to the GCP program account or multi-sig for disbursement.\n\n## Entity Setup and Model\n\nThe GCP working group and Arbitrum Foundation are actively exploring entity setup to ensure DAO transparency while following the rigorous compliance guidelines that surround any entity focused on investments.\n\nThis effort also involves DAO members from the M\\&A, Ops Co, VCDAO, and other initiatives.\n\n# GCP Council\n\nWhat changed: Additional requirements added\n\nThe GCP Council will be a DAO elected group of trusted professionals with backgrounds ranging across gaming, venture, grant allocation, web3 technology, and DAO relations. The group functions as a braintrust that offers their accumulated knowledge to empower the GCP Core Team.\n\nPrimary responsibilities of the GCP Council:\n\n* Collaborate with the GM and IC on deal proposals by providing insights and identifying potential risks (can challenge based on deals not meeting very clear requirements).\n* Offer recommendations on proposed deals after reviewing relevant data and analysis (this analysis would be a standard for all deal memos).\n* Escalate concerns regarding deals to designated oversight bodies if necessary.\n* Review and provide feedback on GCP team

    "description": "# ArbitrumDAO Contribution; Safeguarding Software Developers’ Rights\nAbstract & Rationale - This proposal envisages a monetary contribution to DEF & Coin Center from the ArbitrumDAO to continue their policy, litigation & advocacy efforts in relation to open-source software & software developers’ rights.\n\n*Proposal authored by Immutablelawyer from* [*Axis Advisory*](https://www.axisadvisory.xyz/)\\*\\* \n\n**Context & Preamble**\n\nThe digital asset industry has been faced with recent legal challenges in relation to a software developer’s individual freedom to contribute to the development and subsequent deployment of open-source permissionless software. This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”\n\nOur team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: [Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom 4](https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand)\n\nIn this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF & CoinCenter to continue their policy & litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions’ most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n**COIN CENTER**\n\n1. Coin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain). Albeit the court ruling against Coin Center in the initial proceedings, Coin Center is currently in the process of appealing the judgment.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center is suing OFAC over its Tornado Cash sanction 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/)].\n\n\\[Refer: <https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.74.0.pdf>];\n\n1. Coin Center’s concerns raised to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the designation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing as a primary money laundering concern (PMLC). In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule’s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.\n\n\\[Refer: [Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on “Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern”](https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions-of-primary-money-laundering-conce/)]\n\n1. Coin Center’s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet. Coin Center advocated for clear taxation guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing the importance of a de minimis exemption for minor gains from every transaction to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in daily commerce without undue tax burdens.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center Suggestions to Address Uncertain Tax Treatment of Digital Assets](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-suggestions-to-address-uncertain-tax-treatment-of-digital-assets/)]\n\n1. Coin Center’s contributions to Roman Storm’s and Alexey Pertsev’s legal defense in relation to the following:\n\n* Roman Storm’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operate an unlicensed money transmitter and violating sanctions \\[Court of New York]; and\n* Alexey Pertsev’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of facilitating money laundering \\[Netherlands Court].\n\n**DEFI EDUCATION FUND**\n\nSome of the DeFi Education Fund’s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund initiated a legal challenge against a patent held by True Return Systems, LLC regarding blockchain technology, challenging the novelty and validity of its claims. This action reflects DEF’s commitment to preserve the digital assets space’s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.\n\n\\[Refer: [https://www.defieducationfund.org/\\_files/ugd/84ba66\\_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf1](https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their ‘BEBA token’ via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC’s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf>].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users. DEF emphasizes the need to balance law enforcement’s reach with individual’s financial privacy in the digital realm. They are arguing for a modern interpretation of privacy protections to reflect the realities of digital transactions and the traceability of cryptocurrency activities on public ledgers.\n\n\\[Refer: [DeFi Education Fund Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase Case](https://www.coinlive.com/news/DeFi-Education-Fund-Files-Amicus-Brief-In-Coinbase-Case)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund also contributed to the support of Roman Storm’s legal defense arguing against the novel legal theories proposed by the government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and money laundering statutes. DEF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing software developers from the actions of third-party users, in order to protect software developers from being held liability for third-party misuse of their open-source.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf>].\n\n**OBJECTIVE**\n\n**Coin Center Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to Coin Center; the leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies.\n\nBy way of a brief; Coin Center’s mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.\n\nCoin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.\n\n**DeFi Education Fund Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nThey have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.\n\nAdditionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn’t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.\n\n**CONTRIBUTION TO COIN CENTER \\[A NOTE FROM THE ORGANIZATION]**\n\nFounded in 2014, [Coin Center 4](https://www.coincenter.org/) is an independent non-profit organization focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.\n\nWe are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, [pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance 1](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/). The other is a civil case [challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s designation of immutable smart contracts 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/). We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can’t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.\n\nWe are also coordinating with Roman Storm’s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protects publishing software as “pure speech” warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.\n\nFinally, we are [continuously engaged](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.\n\nA grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry. By supporting this initiative, we affirm our dedication to upholding these principles and defending the right of developers to contribute to the deployment of permissionless open-source software without fear of reprisal or censorship.\n\n**Funding**\n\nAs per the temperature check passed by the ArbitrumDAO on the 24th of April 2024, Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund will receive 500,000ARB each. \n\n**Payment Terms**\n\nThe funds will from this proposal will initially be sent to an account controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation `0x5bb0a919345aF084854BCDc9A6DDdE8b7FEe79aD` , who will handle the transfers to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund:\n\n60% of the funds will be directly sent to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund with the remaining 40% being vested in a linear manner with no cliff for a period of 4 months thereafter.",

This joint proposal requests 1.9 million ARB to fund targeted onboarding incentives, aiming to bring Kwenta users to Arbitrum.\n\n* Full LITPP format\n* Ask of 1.9M ARB, down from 4.5M\n* Detailed onboarding incentives methodology & model: quest-style incentives, one targeting a broad base of users, one specifically scaling CAC to target the highest value users\n* Matt from Stable Lab & LTIPP multisig confirmed to handle accountability, in line with STIP.b requirements\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboard New Users to Kwenta on Arbitrum: Target existing Kwenta users from Optimism and Base, sidelined Kwenta community members eager to trade on Arbitrum, and new DeFi or centralized exchange (CEX) traders. The focus is on attracting a large number of users from other ecosystems.\n2. Retain High-Value Users: Encourage recurring usage from the highest value users from other ecosystems (power users), delivering significant value for Kwenta, Perennial, and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n3. Mutual Growth: Utilize the combined strengths of Kwenta and Perennial to attract a substantial number of new users to Arbitrum beyond the duration of the grant.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\n* Flexible Distribution Methods: Utilize both on- and off-chain data, with off-chain rewards distribution for flexibility, adjusting methods based on effectiveness.\n* Kwenta’s Frontend Application: Leverage Kwenta’s active user base to serve direct incentives through customized notifications within the application, facilitating a higher conversion rate.\n* Seamless Migration Experience: Develop a top-tier user experience for migrating to Arbitrum, minimizing costs, clicks, and time required for users to switch chains.\n\nIncentive Model:\n\n1. Targeted Trader Onboarding Incentives:\n\n* Quest 1 (Mass Onboarding): Aim to onboard up to 2,200 users from the past year, offering a reward of up to $50 to cover migration costs and encourage initial trading on Arbitrum. Users must open at least two trades of at least $1,000 each to qualify for the reward.\n* Quest 2 (Active Trader Incentivisation & Retention): A 12-week quest targeting high-value users. Rewards are divided into tiers based on trading volume, with higher rewards for more active users. Weekly multipliers incentivize consistent trading, and users can opt to vest their rewards for higher future multipliers.\n\n1. Targeted Fee Rebates:\n\n* Allocation: 66.6% for existing Kwenta users and 33.3% for non-Kwenta Arbitrum users.\n* Structure: Rebates are pooled and capped at fees paid, preventing wash trading. Distributed weekly, with options for users to vest their rebates for higher future rewards.\n\n1. Liquidity Bootstrapping Incentives:\n\n* Initial Focus: Primarily on ETH and BTC markets, with expansion to other assets based on trader demand.\n* Approach: Incentives to attract efficient liquidity providers, reducing reliance on retail liquidity, aiming for professional market makers with higher leverage to ensure deep liquidity at lower costs.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms:\n\n* Upfront Onboarding Incentives: Help users overcome switching costs with initial rewards, aiming for conversion to recurring users.\n* Weekly Rewards and Loyalty Multipliers: Encourage users to return regularly and increase their rewards through consistent participation.\n* Tiered Rewards and Vesting Options: Provide higher rewards for increased usage and incentivize users to lock their ARB for additional benefits.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\n* Onboarding KPIs: Measure net-new volume and users onboarded.\n* General KPIs: Track trading volume, open interest (taker), total liquidity (maker), and total value locked (TVL).\n\nGrant Timeline and Milestones:\n\n* Month 1:\n  * Focus on onboarding new users.\n  * Target $10M average daily volume and 250 net-new users.\n* Month 2:\n  * Scale up growth in volume and open interest.\n  * Target $25M average daily volume and 400 net-new users.\n* Month 3:\n  * Retain growth and volume.\n  * Target $50M average daily volume and 500 net-new users.\n\nJustification for Grant:\n\n* Net-New Capital and Users: Kwenta aims to onboard hundreds of users and over a billion in monthly volume to the Arbitrum ecosystem, providing significant value compared to other incentive programs.\n* Arbitrum Perps Proliferation: Kwenta’s perps aggregator will enhance the existing perp ecosystem on Arbitrum, fostering competition and efficiency.\n* Distribution for Innovation: Utilize Kwenta’s user base to introduce Arbitrum-native innovations, such as NFT perps and power perps, directly to the market.\n\nAccountability Details:\n\n* Program Manager: Matt from Stable Labs.\n* Multisig Oversight: A 5-out-of-7 multisig team confirmed to handle funds and ensure accountability.\n* Transparency and Reporting: Regular bi-weekly updates, a final closeout report, and adherence to OpenBlock Labs’ data requirements, ensuring detailed tracking and analysis of program metrics.\n\nCommitment to Arbitrum:\n\n* Alignment with Arbitrum Ecosystem: Kwenta and Perennial demonstrate strong commitment through actions such as launching the Kwenta token on Arbitrum, introducing Arbitrum-native products, and maintaining Arbitrum as the core of their ecosystem.\n* Further Actions: Kwenta plans additional initiatives to deepen its relationship with Arbitrum, including innovative product launches and ecosystem participation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposal seeks a one-off grant due to its unique potential impact, aiming to onboard significant new capital and users to Arbitrum by leveraging Kwenta’s existing user base and Perennial's infrastructure. The proposed incentive mechanisms and detailed execution strategy aim to maximize user onboarding and retention, ensuring long-term benefits for the Arbitrum ecosystem.",

Remaining ARB will be sent back to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.*\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nAs voted on in the ADPC proposal [<u>here</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/43616303506326656287362617487331059827021737444126158637397168372555259240241), one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. As per the [<u>proposal </u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd45c0426919353cbce3e7e2a3e7a00c01f9d606bb7ed6c9788db4598f044b16a)passed on 25-Apr-24, the Arbitrum DAO will fund 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million worth of ARB. \n\nFollowing the rejection of this [<u>proposal</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x285a0ef00fabce6e1d44b10ffff9fff5a30f62649339cfeded113e23bc58cdf1) which sought to set up a Sub-Committee for the Security Services Subsidy Fund based on community feedback received, the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) will be responsible for facilitating the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework, as originally proposed in the [<u>Subsidy Fund Proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958?u=sid_areta). \n\n**Proposal Request**\n\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $2.5 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nA benchmarking exercise was conducted with various security audit service providers, with this [<u>form</u>](https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039) being shared with 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated. Based on this, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 12 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\n**Subsidy Fund Design & Approach**\n\n**Exec View**\n\n·       Up to $2.5 million worth of ARB allocated to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $250K per project (10% of the subsidy fund available).\n\n·       ADPC will be responsible for selection and oversight.\n\n·       The Subsidy Fund will be distributed across 1 cohort of 8 weeks. \n\n**Key Pillars**\n\n**(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria**\n\n**Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund**\n\nBefore considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.\n\nAll applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:\n\n1\\.\t**Transparency & integrity** - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.\n\n2\\.\t**Encouragement of investment** - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.\n\n3\\.\t**Proportionate and necessary** - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.\n\n4\\.\t**Economic neutrality** - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.\n\n5\\.\t**Consideration of funding options** - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.\n\n6\\.\t**Enhancement of beneficiary security** - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary’s protocol.\n\n7\\.\t**Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem** - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.\n\n8\\.\t**Value for Money** - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.\n\n9\\.\t**Probity** - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.\n\n10\\. **Risk Management** - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.\n\n11\\. **Engagement with SMEs** - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.\n\n12\\. **Cyclical Whitelist events** - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.\n\n**Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation**\n\nThe reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.\n\nThe development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.\n\nThe intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a ‘free lunch/handout’. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO’s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.\n\nThe means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.\n\n·       Rating 1: Unsatisfactory\n\n·       Rating 2: Below expectations\n\n·       Rating 3: Meets expectations\n\n·       Rating 4: Above expectations\n\n·       Rating 5: Exceptional\n\nEach of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.\n\nEach application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available. \n\nAfter the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.\n\n**EVALUATION CRITERIA**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/183eecb1-da8e-4f44-b765-382856e3bb73_original.png)<img height=\"445\" width=\"714\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/f75882bb-4d50-4574-b052-3ac70a71d45a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"667\" width=\"707\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/beaaf036-ae7e-46f8-91de-ac581b90721a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"316\" width=\"685\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/b9768498-bdd5-4bcf-831d-4e3f5902d4b3_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"700\" width=\"682\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/12e204ca-2317-406e-a985-f3155a61f1cb_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"332\" width=\"680\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/bd8593cc-2843-45be-a2ec-127de568e880_original.png\" />\n\nRegarding the ‘Ecosystem Contribution’ metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding. These are set out below, along with the rationales for choosing them, providing more weight to such areas.\n\n*Note*: We have removed the Collab Tech and Gaming verticals which were present in the original proposal. There are a number of grants programs already centered around Collab Tech, while the Gaming vertical is sufficiently incentivized via the GCP.\n\n**RWAs & Tokenization**\n\n·       Commands a small proportion of Arbitrum attention and building however is a focus of big institutions & banks deploying large amounts of capital into tokenization.\n\n·       Arbitrum as the home of DeFi is currently trailing in this burgeoning key category (e.g.,[<u> Mantle</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) passed a $60 million support program for tokenized RWAs on their chain and Polygon and Avalanche have been very active in the space).\n\n·       Tokenized treasuries and private credit have [<u>passed $1.3 billion in terms of value tokenized</u>](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries), and are only projected to grow in importance in the near future, highlighted by the recent launch of [<u>BlackRock’s</u>](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/20/blackrock-enters-asset-tokenization-race-with-new-fund-on-the-ethereum-network/) tokenized fund.\n\n·       Forum discussions talking about RWA’s being used as a tool for diversifying the Arbitrum DAO treasury. See[<u> here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-arbitrum-stable-treasury-endowment-program/20139).\n\n**Stylus Adoption**\n\n·       Stylus’s flexibility, as detailed in this [<u>proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust, C and C++, significantly expanding the developer base from an estimated 20,000 Solidity developers to include developers from other languages such as Rust and C++ which have around 3.5 million and 10 million developers respectively.  \n\n·       Provides a more efficient execution environment compared to the EVM, resulting in over 10x cheaper computation and 100x cheaper memory usage. These improvements will lead to substantial gas savings for complex smart contracts, making previously impractical use cases feasible.\n\n·       Enables interoperability between Stylus and EVM contracts, allowing developers to call Rust programs from Solidity and vice versa, seamlessly integrating existing infrastructure such as Oracles with new Stylus-based contracts. \n\n·       Extends capabilities of the EVM without altering its core functionality, providing a long-term competitive advantage for Arbitrum by enabling higher throughput, lower costs, and supporting new use cases.\n\n**(B) Application Process**\n\n**Application & Review Windows**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund will run in 1 cohort of 8 weeks consisting of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. This will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews.\n\n**Initial Screening**\n\nTo efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:\n\n1\\.\tFunding Gap Rationale\n\n2\\.\tReasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested\n\n3\\.\tKPIs\n\n4\\.\tEcosystem Contribution\n\n5\\.\tAccountability Measures\n\n**In-Depth Review & Feedback**\n\nProjects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).\n\n**Award & Monitoring**\n\nOnce approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.\n\n**(C) Selection Process & Reporting**\n\nTransparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.\n\n**Reports**\n\nWe will provide updates on our selections and updates on funded projects. These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:\n\n·       Summary of Achievements for the Month\n\n·       Funds Utilized\n\n·       Milestones Reached\n\n·       Challenges Faced & Plan of Action\n\n·       Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.\n\n·       Next Steps & Priorities\n\n**Output Metrics**\n\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:\n\n·       **Number of Projects Funded:** Number of projects funded.\n\n·       **Total Funds Allocated:** Cumulative sum of funds distributed, showcasing the program’s financial impact.\n\n·       **Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:** As outlined in the Means Test, the two key verticals we have identified are RWAs & Tokenization and Stylus Adoption.\n\n**Outcome Metrics**\n\nDepending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:\n\n·       Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum\n\n·       Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects\n\n**(D) Project Allocation**\n\nOur approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.\n\nTo ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 10% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises up to $2.5 million worth of ARB, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $250K worth of ARB.\n\n**(E) Team Setup**\n\nThe administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.\n\nThe activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC’s mandate extension.\n\n**(G) Governance**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.\n\n**Multi-Sig**\n\nAll providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the ‘KYB’) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.\n\nSubsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.\n\nIn recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.\n\nIt is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the ArbitrumDAO has the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC’s multi-sig wallet using the [<u>Zodiac Governor Module</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability), if necessary.\n\n**Flows of Funds**  \n\nThe $2.5m worth of ARB will be going to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet (0x40FcE28C9f3a0d7B75B917C95960D61D930dCA54) to be converted to an ideal stablecoin via OTC trading, with the funds then being sent to the ADPC multi-sig as explained above. The flow of funds for the entire program can be understood via the diagram below, as outlined in the [<u>ADPC’s Security Services RFP forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031):\n\n<img height=\"467\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffAEBXfRuoEZxoDAz44sbU5B8dsKbm51vlC1dSWJBxBjHPz3sPkSgaOS29V-qw3dyZ_iWO6RP4qlb97h4NbBR4zSPQB-b0VOqtBm8gBmZOosA0p4bLHy9vwNECpvojQGCCFgKGYCX7NbKT5ycXEvEGxDs?key=p_wBOku1sf7Kgrafe-VzeQ\" />\n\n**Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>procurement committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n**Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n\n**Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.",

These are: an effective knowledge base, investment frameworks, and a committed team of experts. We’ll align with DAO budgeting and strategic objectives, building on existing work and GCP learnings as a proof of concept.\nThe result will be capture-resilient to any one party’s interests and aligned with DAO governance best practices.\n\nThe execution of the work scoped in this pilot will lead to a specific proposal for the setup & funding of the Ecosystem Fund (or to smaller proposals for allocating capital to specific targets building up to it). Scope:\n\n1. Funding Ecosystem Health Report\n2. Ecosystem Investment Thesis & Strategy\n3. Strategic Recommendations\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter observing the investment and venture challenges faced by the DAO, its builders, and investors, we need the Arbitrum Ecosystem Fund as a bold and decisive initiative. The significant opportunity cost requires quick action for AVI to produce actionable thesis, strategy, and recommendations. These will empower delegates and groups to make effective decisions, tackling the risks of an otherwise incongruent, piecemeal approach. A lean and pragmatic pilot will address these outcomes in the short term, incl. in relation to live proposals, while demonstrating the viability of a more holistic long term structure and laying a solid foundation for it.\n\n## Rationale\n\nArbitrum is already a highly desirable platform by engineers and a market leader. In order to continue to thrive, the DAO needs to double down on betting on these builders that are growing the ecosystem and expanding the sequencer volumes. Doing so in alignment with treasury sustainability, budgeting, and strategic goals, including increasing protocol revenues, diversifying revenue streams, and opening new markets.\n\nSince AVI started there has been a lot of interest from a broad spectrum of builders and investors. We have seen a growing number of proposals in this category, however selecting the correct mix of solutions, funding them, and ensuring accountability to the ecosystem has proven challenging. Thus AVI is focused on rapidly producing actionable outputs, while unlocking a variety of tactical steps for the DAO.\n\nOutputs:\n\n1. Enable Arbitrum to make the next step towards developing a best-in-class approach to a DAO-led Ecosystem Investment Fund in Web3 including a proposal for its further structure and deployment.\n2. Rigorous understanding of Arbitrum environment, including:\n   1. Funding gaps\n   2. Opportunities outlined by investors\n   3. Free market capital that can be mobilized\n   4. Live proposals for venture initiatives (e.g. BoB, SC, etc)\n3. Develop an Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations aligned with Arbitrum's long term goals to create a unified vision within the DAO on best practices for fostering a thriving venture ecosystem\n4. Develop an Ops plan for applying the Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations\n5. Community engagement for DAO accountability and transparency:\n   1. Evaluating approaches for community engagement in the work of the unit\n   2. Running engagement sessions with educational outcomes on key concepts\n   3. Ensured coordination with the work of other relevant groups\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Deliverables\n\n**Market Consultation Report** (State of Venture in the Arbitrum Ecosystem)\n\n* Discovery summary\n* Deck for Market Consultation\n* Consultation Schedule of 45+ participants (incl. groups that have made proposals to the DAO)\n* Anonymised data\n* Findings and summary\n\n**Thesis and Strategy Report for Investment and Venture Fund**\n\n* Types of funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.)\n* Development of foundational hypothesis for key strategic sectors for growth, investee profiles across multiple stages of maturity, and which markets and trends to focus on (integrated with active work of other working groups)\n* Portfolio construction\n* Evaluation frameworks for funds and initiatives (initial version)\n* Evaluation frameworks for Ecosystem Fund's - Impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation (initial version)\n\n**Set of Strategic Recommendations**\n\n* Roadmap for the next AVI phases (considering emerging constraints and synergetic structures and work groups)\n* Analysis of strategic investment priorities and steps for fund deployment (building on Areta’s M\\&A Pilot)\n* Specific analyzed target deals\n\n**A detailed operational plan for the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative**\n\n* Timeline and milestones for key activities and deliverables\n* Resource allocation and team roles\n* Budget breakdown for next phases with an overall target allocation for Arbitrum having been considered\n\n**Community Engagement Report**\n\n* Recordings of engagement and educational events\n* Decks, Miro boards, and workshop summaries\n* Participation of AVI team in sessions opened by other working groups\n* Proactive engagement with relevant groups (GCP, M\\&A, DAO Budgeting, etc) to include their inputs on thesis, operations and legal\n* Findings on activities and formats producing valuable inputs for venture thesis development, strategy, and execution\n* Key learnings embedded for future community engagement to maintain transparency\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n1. **Proactive engagement and alignment with other working groups and streams including:**\n   1. DAO Budgeting\n   2. Treasury Management\n   3. GCP\n   4. M\\&A\n2. **Full alignment with legal structures and frameworks:**\n   1. GCP legal umbrella setup\n3. **Governance considerations:**\n   1. Top level oversight and control should be based on a committee with roles elected by the DAO\n   2. DAO votes should be triggered for decisions with high material impact like additional capital allocation, liquidating the structure, or actions outside the approved mandate for the roles above\n4. **Best practices on DAO engagement**\n   1. Transparency\n   2. Accountability\n   3. Participatory design (where feasible)\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nTo kick off working towards the Ecosystem Fund, we’re proposing the initial phase that includes:\n\n1. **Creating the State of Arbitrum’s Venture Ecosystem Report** to surface valuable insights from the community, bringing all stakeholders up to speed. This report will highlight successful initiatives and uncover gaps through dozens of discovery and market consultation interviews.\n2. **Building a Thesis and Strategy Report** for Investment and Venture fund set-up in the Arbitrum Ecosystem where we explore funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.), develop the foundational hypotheses for key strategic growth sectors and markets, and explore portfolio construction and evaluation frameworks.\n3. Leveraging these reports, we’ll produce a **set of strategic recommendations and proposal** for AVI to set up the initial iteration of the Ecosystem Fund to manage investment allocations, funding proposals, structuring deals, and managing the outcomes with the likes of RnDAO, EVM Capital, Outlier Ventures, Elixir Capital, and the relevant accelerators coming from ThankARB’s RFP programs. It is intended to be structured as a Fund of Funds, resilient to capture by any one group’s special interests.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we are bringing a team with deep expertise in investment (including a decade in web3), early-stage and growth builders, and ecosystem building around frontier technologies, with 100s of millions deployed, billions in exits, and intimate knowledge of Arbitrum. Profiles are outlined on the forum and Snapshot proposal.\n\n**Core Full time team**\n\nLino & Ana\n\n**Subject-matter experts:**\n\nPaul, Konstantina, Joseph \\[Immutable Lawyer], Anish, Bart\n\n**DAO representative:**\n\nAlex Lumley\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfl_9urpiYt_RYAVg1_rGh6Fd2oOkzgwge1fjirZyybRUs15QEOIPq6HAYmRg-kBQnC3zne7SamtTHDsuvBe2GMnWD4QrTDCk14LqhMnKgvGrNePS3pGwC9nOXZywGoIravo66Q20FBz9iibPc-JqVpuqJj?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"gantt\")\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_rbFVgD9Q15bopYqhSLTScKwO5Sga90mog-c-eltOHB9keQMbyZwvHePknjTwibZEVnjKnjB0rK_oN4mS8u8LGWjD3TKCQjJ_gCdr24vP17WLItfQ1tTMMzLT67C1YvFdCPuo7u9fEqbLaM1nNDvGCMo?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"budget\")\n\n#### Total - **$87,000.00**\n\nArb to be transferred to a Safe MSig (arb1:0x9271A08958C0406F59fc0E0510141563A2FFcD28) composed of the following signers:\n\n* Lino Velev: arb1:0xFf46A0dF4fB1729679420D71089a7dcc16C7fFad\n* Ana-Maria Yanakieva: arb1:0xbE6fE3cE690b8B2e86FA2d4B358386d2211feE1A\n* Alex Lumley: arb1:0xA9cD2D7Fe90321BadD16ebf6b5dB7A6Be099ef2E\n\nThe ARB amount to be transfered is based on the USD equivalent at time of submission with a 35% buffer.

    "description": "# Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS) \n#### [](#final-version-jul-24-1)\n\n## [](#abstract-6)Abstract\n\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency.\n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.**\n\nWe propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.\n\nThis proposal also funds the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.\n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## [](#motivation-7)Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the programs:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png)\n\nThe analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\n![UTS](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png)\n\n![AS CpT](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png)\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png)\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## [](#proposed-solution-8)Proposed solution\n\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n   * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n   * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n     i. 6/12: <$1M\n     ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n     iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n     iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n   * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.\n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n   * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n   * Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process.\n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\n**The funds in the multisigs belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.\n\n## [](#mss-mechanics-9)MSS Mechanics\n\n#### [](#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-10)Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?\n\n* Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Prior experience being on multi-sigs. Understanding of batched transactions and transaction builder.\n  * All multi-sig signers will also undergo training on security best practices and multisig efficacy at the commencement of their role. This training will be completed by Entropy Advisors.\n* Able to complete KYC\n  * The Arbitrum Foundation will conduct KYC on all multisig signers to ensure they are compliant and can serve this role for the DAO.\n* Organisation or professional signers can submit a nomination to be a multi-sig signer. Only one member per organisation.\n  * If nominating an organisation, one member of the company should be listed as the primary point of contact.\n\n#### [](#creating-new-mss-multisigs-11)Creating new MSS multisigs\n\nThe process flow for creating new multisigs is as follows\n\n* Snapshot vote passes\n* Multisig is created by MSS Chair and signers onboard. The 3 chairs will rotate multisig creation responsibility\n* Proposal passes Tally\n* Vaults must be named well to help with organisation\n\n#### [](#processing-payments-through-mss-multisigs-12)Processing payments through MSS multisigs\n\nTo improve security and clarity of payments running through MSS multi-sigs, the following financial controls processes will be maintained:\n\n**Payment request: approval flow**\n\nAt the outset programs using the MSS will define their payment approval flow, including\n\n1. Which individuals can request a payment be made “payment requestor”\n2. Which channel do they need to request it on “payment request channel”\n3. Who else is required to approve it, triggering the payment to be queued via the multisig “payment approver”\n4. A list of approved wallet addresses (maintained in On-chain Den)\n\nThis is an important security step to mitigate the risk that a Program member’s personal accounts will be compromised and used to trigger a payment by the multisig to an unintended party. (i.e. hack someone’s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker’s wallet).\n\nAn example of this structure\n\n1. Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.\n2. Request made in “PL Payment” Telegram group”\n3. Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)\n4. One written approval as indicated by “![:+1:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12 \":+1:\")” on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. “payment approver” cannot also be by “payment requestor”\n\nGiven the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.\n\n**Payment request: format**\n\nPayment requests should be structured as follows by the “payment requestor”\n\nName of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence\n\nThis will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. “Tooling”, “Contributor payment”, “legal fees”). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.\n\n#### [](#payment-signing-den-implementation-13)Payment signing: Den implementation\n\n* To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of [Den](https://www.onchainden.com/) across all MSS multisigs.\n  * Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you’re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers\n  * Security: Den helps you know what you’re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what’s behind any address.\n\n#### [](#conflict-of-interest-policy-14)**Conflict of Interest Policy**\n\nIn order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.\n\nA conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it’s signers directly for their services)\n2. Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.\n3. Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer’s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.\n4. Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer’s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.\n\nProcedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:\n\n* Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.\n* Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.\n* Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold >50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.\n\nAll COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#removal-of-mss-members-15)**Removal of MSS members**\n\nThere are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:\n\n1. DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).\n2. MSS Member Agreement: If at least 8 MSS members (8 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.\n\nIf a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:\n\n* Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.\n* Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.\n\nAll removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#expectations-of-mss-members-16)**Expectations of MSS members**\n\nTransactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between. If there are more than 3 lapses in expectations over the course of a 2 month period, chairs are expected to communicate that to the DAO and potentially remove the signer.\n\n#### [](#clawback-capability-17)**Clawback Capability**&#xA;\n\n*We are in the process of implementing Zodiac Governor Module in the first multisig to so that the DAO has the ability to clawback funds and replace multisig members. Please note that the Zodiac Governor Module is an imperfect mechanism because it requires a DAO proposal to execute changes, and multisig signers can move faster than the DAO.*\n\nFor future multisigs, we believe each multisig should be set up with the DAO maintaining the ability to clawback funds. In order to execute this, multisigs should be set up using the same model as the security council, by making upgradeexecutor as a module so that DAO maintains full authoritative power.\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95>\n\nWe believe this same mechanism can be used to transfer ownership of the multisigs to new members when new elections take place in 12 months. *This might require a slight technical change,  we are awaiting confirmation from the Foundation.*\n\n## [](#token-flow-reporting-18)Token Flow Reporting\n\n#### [](#r3gen-reporting-on-token-flow-19)r3gen Reporting on Token Flow\n\n**Token Flow | Scope**\nTo aid in the transparency and clarity of reporting within the DAO, we are also proposing the publication of a monthly “Token Flow Report,” which will include illustrate expenditure amounts and breakdowns for all Arbitrum MSS-managed multisigs. In addition, r3gen finance will provide insights on inflows from Sequencer Flows and a high-level summary of other direct outflows from the Arbitrum Treasury to programs not coordinated under the MSS framework.\n\nThis approach will synergise with the operational execution created by the MSS to provide holistic insights into expenditures and the movement of Token in/out of the Treasury. Moreover, it will reduce the finance-admin burden on individual programs, relieving them of the need to track, draft, and publish exhaustive financial updates themselves whilst also providing the DAO with a clear mechanism to ensure spending within the organisation is consistent with the structure outlined within each proposal.\n\nWithin this role, r3gen finance will also lead the development of deeper financial insights and be open to requests by delegates and the community for further specific analysis. This can be requested either via a google form or by commenting directly on the report in the forum. Ultimately, this will enable the DAO to have, at it’s fingertips, the detailed financial insights it needs to support decision-making.\n\nWith the inclusion of Token Flow Reporting, the DAO can unlock the next layer of accounting and reporting on top of the MSS and together creates a holistic backroom finance function to provide the DAO with much-needed data around spending. This will enhance the DAO’s transparency, accountability, and impact.\n\nWe encourage you to review the [first iteration of the Token Flow report](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/939461097/) to get a sense of its design.\n\nMoving forward, financial items within the report will include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Transaction fees, split between the various components of the fee\n  * L1 base, L1 surplus, L2 base, L2 surplus fees\n  * Fee inflows into DAO-controlled wallets\n* Sequencer fees (L1 base fee)\n  * Fee outflows into the sequencer’s wallet\n* Treasury holdings, including the breakdown of treasury allocation to various underlying tokens\n* Forward-looking spending estimations based on active proposals\n* Runway scenario forecasting based on historical/projected spend\n* DAO expenditure by:\n  * Category (such as user incentives, direct grants, grant programs etc.)\n  * Program (such as STIP, LTIP etc.)\n  * Function (such as committee members, advisors etc.)\n* Comparison of total proposed spend vs. actual spend to date for each major DAO-funded initiative, split between each function within the program where possible\n* Contributor Spending Analysis\n* Multisig Spend Analysis\n* Detailed Statement of Token Flows in each of the major tokens the DAO operates in, highlighting\n  * The starting token balance\n  * Inflows of the token (“income”)\n  * Outflows of the token (“expenditure”)\n  * Closing token position\n\nThis report is just the starting point. With community feedback, we will continue to develop and iterate on the monthly token flow report to provide deeper insights and analysis of what the community wants to see. This team will host a monthly finance call on the public calendar to discuss the report’s outputs and collect community feedback to inform the next iteration.\n\nIf you have any specific feedback you would like to see reflected in the report we encourage you to reach out to Pepperoni\\_Jo3 or Jono\\_Gibbs on Telegram.\n\n**Token Flow | Team**\n\nToken Flow Reporting at Arbitrum DAO will be coordinated by a team of four (Elliott, Jono, Matthew and Pepperoni Joe) who bring professional “Big Four” expertise and extensive experience working across top web3 protocols, including Swell, Aave, Gitcoin, Index Coop, Inverse Finance, Squid, Vote Agora, Enzyme, Treasure.\n\n**Token Flow | Pricing for Token Flow Report:**\n\n$6650 USD per month paid upfront in ARB on the 1st of the month using USD/ARB spot price. This includes the web3 accounting sub-ledgers fee and other monthly tooling costs (approximately $750). Work has been ongoing since June to prepare the first Token Flow Reporting which will be published in August, covering the DAO’s finances from Genesis to July 2024. The full monthly payment for August will be paid on the 1st of August, OR when the Tally vote is successfully passed and multi-sig set up to receive funds, whichever is latest. Work done to prepare the report through June and July will not be billed; that will be free on us (r3gen) for the DAO.\n\n### [](#estimated-savings-20)Estimated Savings\n\n**Current Structure**\n\nProject forward estimated multisig cost for the DAO is a challenge, but assuming multisig costs project in line with historical, some future scenarios of yearly cost are displayed below:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.33.48 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cdbcff5a6e9542b2bd21661eeeb7de9f1dff8ae0_2_690x191.png)\n\n\\*assuming ARB allocation cost per multi-sig breakdown as aligned with historic\n\nCurrent spend on multisig with Arbitrum DAO is high, and spending could increase significantly if the number of new multisigs or ARB price increases significantly. This indicates that implementing this proposal would be of significant financial benefit to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Proposed Structure**\nFor implementation of all aspects of this proposal, we estimate the structure will incur a cost of $313,800 per year.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/e2359ae9-327b-4203-9439-23789f17f6ce_original.png)\n\n[](#budget-21)**Budget**\n\nWe propose an allocation of 600,000 ARB to fund an approximately 1+ year multi-sig budget for the DAO. As compensation is denominated in $, but paid in ARB, the specific duration that this budget will fund signers cannot be accurately determined. Assuming the program succeeds, a renewal proposal will be drafted to top up this budget to fund continued signer payments. This will be done in parallel to a reelection process of signers performing this function.\n\n### [](#timeline-22)",

We will call for feedback on our workload and goals, and ask for suggestions as to how to either add new initiatives or remove existing ones from our workload. We will additionally host an Entropy office hour biweekly open to all.\n\nNon-material change clarifying that Entropy has the ability to claim/bill its monthly payments instead of the foundation transferring funds at a monthly cadence.

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.\n\nWith a budget of $2.47M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO’s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors’ employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem’s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:\n\n1. **Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.**\n2. **Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.**\n3. **Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n4. **Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.**\n5. **Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.**\n6. **Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.**\n\nToday the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.\n\nOur team ([@swmartin19](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19), [@mattonchain](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain), and [@pruitt](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt)) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by [highlighting flaws ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91)in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.\n\nEntropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.\n\nToday, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi & R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see [OpCo 2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737) proposal from @dkpremia that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.\n\nWith the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.\n\n# Entropy’s Portfolio\n\nAt the beginning of May, we [introduced ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9)Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n[<img height=\"478\" width=\"269\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_269x478.jpeg\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96.jpeg)\n\n\n\n* Worked with [@r3gen\\_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance) to create a [proposal 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916) that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n* We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most [competent applicant rosters](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss-nomination-thread/24773) (40 in total) in the DAO’s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.\n  * The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.\n  * Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.\n* Conducted [research](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730) into Arbitrum DAO’s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO’s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n  * Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO [budgeting](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-the-creation-of-a-dao-budget/24802) and sequencer [revenue](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-arbitrums-fees-and-sequencer-revenue/24824) through working group calls.\n  * Followed up with a formal [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adjusting-arbitrum-s-gas-fees/25002) to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.\n  * **This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.**\n  * We also [tapped](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802) on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO’s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.\n* [Moved quickly](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730) to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n  * This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above. Everyone wanted Arbitrum DAO representation in Brussels and Entropy stepped in to get it done.\n* Introduced a [governance calendar ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136)that encourages proposals to start and finish Snapshot and Tally voting on the same day each week, requires some support from delegates before proposals move to Snapshot from the Forum, and a holiday break at the turn of the new year.\n  * The goal of this proposal was to reduce delegate fatigue by incorporating a more predictable structure, and ensuring things only go to Snapshot once they have been thoroughly reviewed by the broader community.\n* As mentioned above, Entropy has bi-weekly meetings with active delegates, members from OCL, and the Foundation in an effort to streamline communication throughout the DAO. This has helped ensure no two entities are working on the same thing in silos and will become more important in the future as we define the DAO’s long-term strategic vision.\n* By leveraging our existing network, we have kicked off discussions with potential major partners for the DAO. We will always be representing Arbitrum DAO in a high-value context, even though sometimes it won’t be visible to the broader DAO until the end of the negotiations’ lifecycle.\n\n# Specifications\n\nIf this proposal passes, Entropy Advisors will sign a 1-year exclusivity agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation. The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:\n\n### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n\n* Neutral Proposal Broker\n  * Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n  * Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n* Proposal Incubation\n  * Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO’s best interests in mind.\n  * The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises—we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n  * Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.\n\n### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment\n\n* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum’s key stakeholders\n  * Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n  * Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n* Product and Strategy\n  * Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n  * Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n  * Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\nData and Brand Building\n\n* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n  * Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n  * Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n* Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n  * Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n\n# Vision\n\nOur vision for working with the Arbitrum DAO is structured in three key phases, each building upon the success of the previous one to ensure a thriving partnership.\n\n### \\[Complete] Phase 1: Establishing The Foundation For Entropy<>Arbitrum\n\nIn the initial phase, our focus was on establishing a solid foundation by identifying and addressing key pain points within the DAO. This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.\n\nDuring Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO’s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.\n\n### \\[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.\n\nOver the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation & Rationale section.\n\nWe will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.\n\nLeveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.\n\nThrough strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.\n\n### Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine\n\nIn Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.\n\nAt this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy’s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.\n\n# Short Term Deliverables\n\nWe are committed to defining clear goals for the coming weeks and months, while also encouraging collaboration with other contributors. Our proposed initiatives include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. **Proposal for a DAO-led Events Strategy**\n2. **Facilitate Process to Get OpCo Up and Running**\n   a. Part 1: Ratifying DAO vision, mission, and goals\n   b. Part 2: Establishing oversight mechanisms\n   c. Part 3: Outlining a barebones scope for OpCo, including a budget for setup and initial roles\n3. **Proposal for Chain Economic Parameters Management**\n4. **Ready to Turn Failed Proposals into Frameworks**\n   a. If needed, transforming unsuccessful proposals into actionable frameworks (as needed, potentially treasury mgmt, incentives, etc for example)\n5. **Kickstarting Stylus Development Proposal(s)**\n6. **Proposals for Bringing Strategic Partners for the DAO (Stablecoin, Gaming, Native DEX, Dev Shop, for example)**\n7. **Author at least 1 research report that provide the DAO insight into problems we identify**\n8. **Delegate Code of Conduct Proposal**\n9. **Hiring a Data Analyst**\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where multiple parties can work and provide input together to achieve these objectives.\n\nIn order to address our promise to give the DAO the ability to directly and openly provide input into the work we are facilitating, we will be posting monthly Short Term Deliverables similar to the ones included above in an “Entropy” category in the forum. We will call for feedback on our workload and goals, and ask for suggestions as to how to either add new initiatives or remove existing ones from our workload. We will additionally host an Entropy office hour biweekly open to all.\n\n# Cost & Budget Breakdown\n\n**Salaries: $1.96M**\n\n* Justification: According to [Delphi 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit), a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.\n\n**Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K**\n\n* Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D\\&O + E\\&O insurance, accountant’s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.\n\n**Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K**\n\n* Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small “Happy Hour” type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.\n\n**Assorted Software: $21K**\n\n* Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.\n\n**Office / Misc: $70K**\n\n* Justification: Covers expenses for coworking spaces, office equipment (laptops, podcast materials, office stipend), dinner stipend for late nights, and other miscellaneous costs to support a productive work environment.\n\n**Operating Budget Subtotal: $2.246M**\n\n**Margin / Contingency (~10%): $224K**\n\n* Justification: Provides a buffer for unforeseen expenses and ensures the project’s smooth progression and some potential profit for the company over year 1.\n\n### Total Budget: $2.47M\n\n## Payment Details and Clawback\n\nWhile the Entropy team scales, they will be eligible to claim a reduced $100,000 per month and after crossing the threshold of 7 employees dedicated to Arbitrum, will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments ($2,470,000/12 = $205,834) for the remainder of the 12 month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time.\n\nA total of 6 million ARB will be sent to the Foundation, for them to monetize at their discretion to secure at least $2,470,000. Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### Termination and Clawback\n\nThe DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum’s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### ARB Bonus – Maximum of 1.5M ARB\n\nThe Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 10% bonus, 25% bonus, or a 40% bonus. The bonus will be denominated in the dollar equivalent of ARB in relation to the initial funding amount ($2.47M) requested in this proposal. For example, if the DAO is only slightly pleased with the amount of work we conduct and the 10% bonus is voted for, Entropy will receive $247K of ARB tokens – which will depend on the spot price of ARB at the time of the snapshot’s passing. The amount of ARB distributed as a bonus cannot exceed the 1.5M ARB amount being escrowed by the Foundation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.\n\n### Return\n\nThe Foundation will send all funds in excess of – $2,470,000 + 1.5 million ARB – back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.\n\n### Transparency Reporting\n\nAt the end of each fiscal quarter, we will publish a transparency report that goes over our activities and total spending. Information included will be what we have done, an analysis of impact, and the total cost associated with running the business.\n\n## Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place. Entropy will be the spearhead of catalyzing operational change and leave long-lasting structure in its wake.",

    "description": "# Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking **5,134 ETH**, which is a combination of:\n\n* **Assertion and challenge bonds.** 4,234 ETH to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first honest and active proposer.\n* **Service fees.** 500 ETH to pay proposers who are actively participating and advancing the chain. We estimate the funds will last for 3 years of operation and the Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to collect any service fees.\n* **Refund L1 gas costs.** 400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for active proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.\n\nThis proposal is **contingent** on the proposal “[AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)” (constitutional AIP) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return the funds, in its entirety, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days of the [BOLD proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) being hypothetically rejected.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe [AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) is scoped to only propose the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet include the introduction of an economic incentive mechanism. In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n* **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n* **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n* **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n* **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n* **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n* **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n* **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n# **Budget Request**\n\nThis section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.\n\n## Assertion and Challenge Bonds (4,234 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n\n* 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n* Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the `RollupCore.sol` contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One\n\n**Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.**\n\n## Service Fees for BOLD Validators (500 ETH)\n\nAll blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.\n\nIn the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the [Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr).\n\n**We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward**. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n\n* Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.\n\nThe Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for **up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases)** in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains’ sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.\n\nTo learn more, please read the section on [Service Fees in the BOLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\n***Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.***\n\n## Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs (400 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n\n* **Posting assertions.** An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n* **Challenges.** A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\n*Note: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed and it is expected the service fee will be sufficient to help cover the operational cost for it.*\n\n### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nThis section focuses on the estimated costs to reimburse the L1 gas costs for proposers who are actively posting assertions and participating in the challenge process.\n\n#### Assertion Gas Costs\n\nThe on-chain gas costs for posting assertions are available from the BoLD testnet deployed on [Arbitrum Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x06a5851f1d2daa5312161efefb62f0c561319f46ca97215a0fbe144774b6d65e):\n\n* **‘stakeOnNewAssertion’ function.** It costs 163,109 gas per invocation.\n\nAssertions are expected to be posted every hour and under normal operations:\n\n* 163109 gas \\* 24 hours \\* 365 days = 1,428,834,840 gas per year.\n\nIf we assume 50 gwei/gas on L1 Ethereum, then the estimated total gas costs will be 71.44 ETH/year. This equates to 214.32 ETH for a 3-year period.\n\n#### Challenge Bonds Gas Costs\n\nA challenge should only occur if a dishonest proposer posts an assertion that is not valid. Given the financial cost to a dishonest proposer, we are not expecting many challenges to occur. Even so, we should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario and be ready to defend against it.\n\nAccording to the [BoLD whitepaper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491) and theoretical calculations conducted by the Offchain Labs team, honest moves to defend a full challenge will cost honest parties roughly 62,632,000 gas (not including the top-level assertion).\n\nPer challenge, the L1 gas costs will depend on the gas price at the time of the challenge:\n\n* At a 50 gwei/gas price, this equals 3.1316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 100 gwei/gas price, this equals 6.2632 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 500 gwei/gas price, this equals 31.316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n\nAssuming one challenge per year for 3 years in the worse case scenario on gas prices, we estimate 93.93 ETH will be required.\n\n#### *Gas Cost Summary*\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs incurred for posting assertions and for performing honest moves to defend Arbitrum in the event of one challenge per year, the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\n# Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate. (completed)\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot (both passed).\n   a. [**Bond sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x81cc53932edd0891c8f93a502a1ea929ba1ef1ebf76701663c52d5167b323a6d)**.** Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4,234 ETH to run the first BOLD validator and to cover for one BOLD challenge.&#x20;\n   b. [**Operational cost sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9a4800da3ebd6792a59f02d70467fc6ae158ec2d3d1d941cf095a54cb7c7f0d5)**.** Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer. Total request is 900 ETH to cover a 3-year period.\n3. **Onchain AIP on Tally** (this vote)\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to 2 multi-sig wallets controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.&#x20;\n   a. The first multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig A) will receive 4,234 ETH for posting the bond assertion to become the first BoLD validator, as well as to cover for one BoLD challenge, and&#x20;\n   b. the other multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig B) will receive the 900 ETH meant for service fees and L1 gas costs reimbursements.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the 3,600 ETH from Multi-Sig A (first multi-sig) in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the [AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) is passed.\n\n# Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 5,134 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n\n* Multi-Sig A\n  * 3600 ETH to run the first BOLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One,\n  * 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge,\n* Multi-Sig B\n  * 500 ETH as service fees for active BOLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n  * 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\n**Notable points:**\n\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,**\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,**\n* **All service fee payments will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.**\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to 2 multi-sig SAFE addresses controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation,  and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the bonds (i.e. 3600 ETH from Multi-Sig A) back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n\n* **Withdrawal Address.** The funds will be deposited into BoLD and the withdrawal address set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n* **Triggering Withdrawal.** The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).\n\nArbitrumDAO also reserves the right to revoke the 634 ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge (Multi-Sig A); the 500 ETH budget for service fees (Multi-Sig B) and the 400 ETH to reimburse L1 gas costs (Multi-Sig B). The DAO can revoke these funds by raising and passing a Snapshot proposal that requests the Arbitrum Foundation to return the relevant funds to the DAO treasury. The Snapshot proposal will have to meet the quorum of a non-constitutional AIP in order to pass. The Arbitrum Foundation is bound by its [<u>bylaws</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf) to serve the needs of the DAO, so if the DAO decides that it wants to clawback funds, the Foundation will be obliged to do so.\n\nPut another way, the ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds back to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. This model can be used for future proposals if other entities want to run a proposer on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO.",

    "description": "# ARB Staking: Unlock ARB Utility and Align Governance\n## [](#p-52947-constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nConstitutional\n\n*\\* Please note that, while the ARB Staking proposal as a whole is constitutional, this onchain proposal targets the Treasury Governor because it controls the ARB treasury.* &#x20;\n\n## [](#p-52947-abstract-2)Abstract\n\nWe propose to unlock ARB utility and improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## [](#p-52947-motivation-3)Motivation\n\nThe ARB token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).\n* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/36330652-45ac-4d38-b352-1b1598e84c95_original.png)\n\nThe ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism\n\n* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance\n* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/18155bf2-6c43-4e4d-a386-ac4136f0e3d1_original.png)\n\nMeanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).\n\nARB Staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB Staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## [](#p-52947-rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.\n\n## [](#p-52947-specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### [](#p-52947-system-architecture-6)System architecture\n\nARB Staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.\n\nGovernance Staking\n\n* Requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards (see Karma Integration)\n* Accepts arbitrary fee sources as rewards\n* Is based on Uniswaps audited [UniStaker](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker). Each pool of staked tokens are held in their own special purpose smart contract which can only delegate its own voting power. The governance contract is simple, permissionless, audited and has no special authorities. The contract is upgradable only via Constitutional Proposal by the Arbitrum DAO.\n* Each user owns their own staking vault, and is free to use Governance Staking regardless of whether or not they use stARB (see Tally Protocol LST section below). This allows for maximum flexibility for the DAO and lets others also build yield generating infrastructure for the ARB token.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/044f363e-3ac1-4402-8264-d68b77da5dc6_original.png)\n\nThe DAO\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB Staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\nstARB (Tally Protocol LST)\n\n* Creates a *receipt token* for the ARB which is staked through it, called stARB, and it returns it to the user. The underlying tokens that are staked on the users behalf are always available to redeem, 1:1 plus rewards if applicable, at any time.\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Administers its own Governance Staking vault, not any other vault. stARB has no special powers over the staking contract, and has no access to user’s tokens other than the tokens it manages itself.\n* Will be deployed as an immutable, non-upgradeable contract. The delegation strategies part of the system will upgradeable via Arbitrum DAO Constitutional Proposal. The only part of the system Tally manages is the rebalancing of underlying assets.\n* Can have a withdrawal period, which is configurable by the DAO. The expectation is that any withdrawal period will be very short and is there only to prevent people from abusing the reward mechanism (i.e. staking right before a reward, claiming a chunk of it, and immediately unstaking). If there is a price difference, arbitrageurs can instantly unstake stARB and sell it as ARB to close the price difference. This easy arbitrage opportunity minimizes price discrepancies and makes it difficult for any potential governance attacker to acquire ARB at a discount.\n* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate.\n* Has the ability to return voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship by implementing a [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) client. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/bdb099d8-154c-4a6c-b9e7-675c2b438159_original.png)\n\n### [](#p-52947-karma-integration-7)Karma integration\n\nGovernance Staking requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards. We will define an “active delegate” using Karma Score. The implementation of Karma for ARB Staking is designed to be modular. If, in the future, the DAO wishes to add additional or alternative providers to define “active delegate”, it can do so. The DAO will define the Karma Score requirement for being considered an active delegate. Karma Score is a combination of delegate’s Snapshot voting stats, onchain voting stats and their forum activity. To accurately calculate forum activity score, delegates are required to prove ownership of their forum handle by [signing a message](https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum) with their delegate address and posting on the forum. The current Karma score formula is below, which can be adjusted by the DAO going forward:\n\n((100) \\* ((Forum Activity Score \\* 1) + (Off-chain Votes % \\* 3) + (On-chain Votes % \\* 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting \\* 1)\n\nKarma Score will be included in ARB staking via a smart contract that writes data onchain from the Karma API. We will include several guardrails to ensure that this aspect of the implementation is robust and decentralized:\n\n* Users can verify Karma score calculations independently.\n* The DAO will have the ability to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly.\n* If Karma scores fail to arrive or the scores are blocked by the DAO, ARB Staking will distribute rewards to all stakers regardless of whether they are delegated to an active governance participant until the situation is resolved.\n\nIn the future, we believe it would make sense to integrate delegate incentives with ARB staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the ARB treasury, they come directly from onchain revenue. We will lead a working group to develop a recommendation on this topic.\n\nTally will build ARB staking into our existing [Arbitrum DAO platform](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.\n\n### [](#p-52947-parallel-workstreams-staking-rewards-and-delegation-working-groups-8)Parallel workstreams: Staking Rewards and Delegation working groups\n\nIn parallel with the development of ARB Staking, we will lead two separate DAO working groups that are focused on aspects of the system that will be implemented after development is complete.\n\n* The Staking Rewards working group will focus on how to fund staking rewards. It will develop a recommendation about whether staking rewards should be funded by sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, treasury diversification, and/or DAO venture investments and how to implement such rewards.\n* The ARB Staking & Delegation working group will focus on how to define an active contributor to the Arbitrum DAO, delegate incentives, and voting power distribution. It will collaborate with Tally and Karma to develop recommendations on Karma Score formula, the minimum Karma Score required to be eligible for staking.\n\nThe working groups will be formed via an open call for contributors that will be posted after this proposal passes the temp check stage. Each working group will deliver their recommendations in October, so that the recommendations can be turned into DAO proposals and created following the implementation of ARB Staking.\n\n### [](#p-52947-integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-9)Integration with future Arbitrum staking systems\n\nWe anticipate that multiple Arbitrum staking systems will be developed over time, perhaps to incentivize decentralized block production in BoLD or to create an efficient MEV market in Time Boost. We view multiple staking systems as complementary. Each system would ask the staker to do different work for Arbitrum, take different risks, and pay out different rewards. Having multiple systems lets ARB holders pick between different risk/reward payoffs and specialize in different types of work to secure the system.\n\n## [](#p-52947-estimated-timeline-10)Estimated Timeline\n\nPost proposal on forum for feedback: June\n\nPost temp check proposal on Snapshot: August\n\nPost onchain proposal on Tally for funding: August\n\nBegin development: August\n\nSubmit smart contracts for audit: September\n\nSubmit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB Staking implementation: October\n\nPublish working group recommendations and turn them into DAO proposals: November\n\n## [](#p-52947-overall-cost-11)Overall Cost\n\nIf this proposal passes temperature check, we will submit an onchain proposal that includes $200,000 USD in ARB of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Develop ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* Implement staking contracts\n* Integrate Arbitrum’s current and potential fee mechanisms\n* Integrate Karma Score requirement\n* Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n\n$20,000 USD in ARB: Integrate ARB Staking into Tally.xyz\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Integrate Karma into ARB Staking\nDevelop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n\n* Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n* Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving Arbitrum community needs\n* Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n\n$60,000 USD in ARB: Audit ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* The final cost of the audit including documentation will be published on this thread.

    "description": "# Delegate to Voter Enfranchisement Pool — Event Horizon\n# **Summary**\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [<u>recently passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin. \n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. Further, to ensure community alignment, a 5 member Oversight Committee will be paid a 125k ARB stipend broken up into monthly payments.&#x20;\n\n# **Problem**\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n# **Mechanism**\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who *do vote*, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who *don’t vote* to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low…** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high…** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today’s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n**Delegation rationale**\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum’s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2. Neutral and Open: By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.\n\n**Grant rationale**\n\n1. While we initially didn’t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of “do not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community”. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation. \n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members [<u>were paid 25k ARB each</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/110767177349707239820875764565747830009768307680609166467172874966002003291288) for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We’re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today’s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. This is not to depreciate the value of LTIPP committee members, but to draw a humble comparison of the value of our engineering and governance labor both already done and yet to come in this next year. In fact, this pricing (adjusting for price action between LTIPP and now) explicitly values the work of LTIPP committee members at nearly 19x that of the Event Horizon team ($6.7k per LTIPP committee member per week vs. $480 per EH team member per week), not counting the previous year of work that went into building the already functioning product.\n\nWe will also have to pay for a Snapshot subscription which is $6k / year which will come out of the grant. Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum – 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process – 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX – 40k ARB\n4. Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1k worth of ARB), etc. – 40k ARB\n5. Service fee – 40k ARB &#x20;\n\n# **Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:**\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\n1. Misaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\n*Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.*\n\n1. Inflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n2. Non-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more Arb could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ARB tokens are still retained by the treasury.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO [<u>just voted</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation. \n\nWhile there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn’t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it’s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually *inclusive*, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals and placed over $55,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $55,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. Across all proposals for which the Event Horizon Community has participated, the community’s cumulative voter footprint is on pace to exceed $55,000,000. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\n**Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed ~500**Our community members have participated in and passed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to Arbitrum or other DAO proposals.\n\n**Voter Participation: >30%**Over thirty percent of our community members have participated in our metagovernance proposals. Some participants have voted as many as 63 times in under 5 months. Check out the latest info on our leaderboard: EventHorizon.vote/leaderboard\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: >$365,000 (and counting)**For the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: >121,500x (and growing)**The average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $365,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority\n\n# **Steps to Implementation**\n\nPer the recommended process of the Arbitrum Foundation, the DAO moves 7.2m ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet (0x15C4edF2cF2f36335e42c19E506Ed6cB16a57D8F) which will then delegate to the Arbitrum Community Governance wallet.\n\nThe EventHorizonArbitrum.eth wallet automatically votes in support of the passholder consensus while the Oversight Committee can force an Abstain vote with a ⅗ vote to do so. The five signers are:\n\n1. Michael (Open Zeppelin) 0xBE1d294FD9B71Ae2F6831Eb80777fF73fb73c953\n2. Frisson (Tally): 0xb5D8fe0De11e6a95F1c2D217C55dc4f010EAc7c1\n3.

DisruptionJoe (Arbitrum Delegate): 0x01Cf9fD2efa5Fdf178bd635c3E2adF25B2052712\n\nThe Oversight Committee members will also receive a monthly stipend of 2083 ARB per month so as to maintain an ethos of “your labor is paid” in the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\nAfter initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance. \n\nAgain, this delegation would not be a grant and funds would remain in the DAO-controlled wallet. Consider us a delegate + service provider like any of the other talented delegates and service providers currently supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem.The 200K grant distributions are to be sent to an Event Horizon safe with the 75K ARB direct grant to be retained and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments being emitted to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs.\n\n# **Technical Implementation**\n\nPer the recommendation of the Arbitrum Foundation, the proposal will forego the Franchiser contract approach in favor of a multi-signature wallet structure. With the passing of this proposal, the DAO will transfer 7M ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet. The Oversight Committee will then delegate the voting rights to the Arbitrum Community Delegation wallet. Should the DAO wish to recall the delegation, an on chain vote will no longer be required. Instead, a snapshot proposal will suffice. In addition to all previously mentioned rights, the Oversight Committee will be beholden to a community Snapshot vote, and will retain the ability to undelegate and return all ARB to the DAO treasury at any point per the request of the DAO.\n\n*Previous Model for Reference: In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. We suggest that the Foundation aids in the creation of this contract in order to create an official and safe implementation, though we can likely fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs* [*implementation*](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA) *\\[*[*github*](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser)*] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we request that the Foundation take the time to fork the contract and hire an auditor to check the implementation.*\n\n*The contract has simple functions:*\n\n* *Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address*\n* *FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses*\n* *Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.*\n* *RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.*\n\n*It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO’s balance sheet as it has full-control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO’s ownership.*\n\n*Forking and auditing this franchiser contract would be useful for Arbitrum’s version of* [*retroactive delegation*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-12-empowering-underrepresented-delegates/21533) *(updated version to be posted shortly). Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH’s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the* [*community’s call*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-call-for-creative-uses-of-delegation-to-boost-participation/21235/7) *for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.*\n\n# **Additional Considerations**\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal.\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, we will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance.",

The reasons for the republication being:\n\n1\\. The former was posted outside the approved calendar window of Thursday 12:00 UTC and we like to avoid ineligibility\n\n2\\. A correction was made on the ARB sum values\n\n3\\. The executable has been simplified to a single tx to avoid any potential execution issues\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1-year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices.&#x20;\n\n\n\nThe Gitcoin DAO has recently passed a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin.&#x20;\n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. In addition, to ensure community alignment, a separate 125K ARB grant will be paid to the 5 member Oversight Committee in monthly installments. Grant Grand Total: 325K ARB.\n\n# Problem\n\nToday, the typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation and surfaces greater cognition from the community.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low-capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don’t vote to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low…** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high…** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today’s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# Rationale\n\n## Delegation rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum’s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2.

While we initially didn’t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of “do not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community”. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation.&#x20;\n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members were paid 25k ARB each for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We’re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today’s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses.

Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum – 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process – 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX – 40k ARB\n4.

The 200K ARB direct grant will be retained by EH, and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments will be emitted proportionally to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs over the coming 12 months.\n\n2\\.

Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH’s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the community’s call for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.\n\n# Additional Considerations\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, Event Horizon will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance.&#x20;",

    "description": "# Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum’s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum’s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum’s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum’s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from Arbitrum DAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event’s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon’s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community’s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from Arbitrum and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a **$100,000 USD commitment**, payable in ETH, ARB, or USDC. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event’s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Multi-Sig Address for DAO Deposit\n\nTo deposit the funds, the Arbitrum DAO can use the following multi-sig address:\n**0x022ec7543BfB377BbEB6676E5ba5Ecf3950dA889**",

    "description": "# [NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee: Phase II Proposal\n# Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee: Phase II Proposal\n\n# **Contents**\n\nI. Executive Summary\n\nII. Background of the ADPC\n\nIII. Achievements & Progress\n\nIV. Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I\n\nV. Phase II Mandate\n\nVI. Budget & Methodology\n\nVII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II\n\nVIII. Transparency & Community Engagement\n\nIX. Checks & Balances\n\nX. Multi-Sig\n\nXI. ARB Conversion Strategy\n\n# **I. Executive Summary**\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (”ADPC”), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC’s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain. \n\n### **Outcome**\n\nThe ADPC’s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.\n\nWe laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.\n\n### **Way Ahead**\n\nThe ADPC's initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC's engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:\n\n**1.** **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 tactical verticals**\n\n* Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.\n* The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.\n* Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.\n\n**2. Work Package 2:** Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.\n\n**3. Work Package 3**\n\n* Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).\n* The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;  further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this separate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.\n\n**4. Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have \\[published]\\(https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as) for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.\n* Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n* Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n**5. Optional Additional Verticals:** On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.\n\nThe overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget & Methodology section. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 954,608 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $**0.5204**/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC's members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.\n\nThe multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) established by Entropy Advisors. The Multi-Sig that has been created by the MSS is the following address:\n\n**arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0**\n\nAfter receipt of the ARB, the ADPC will convert as much of the requested amount as is required to obtain 414,000 USDC and will return the unutilized ARB to the DAO treasury. This is intended to avoid fluctuations in ARB price and ensures that the ADPC avoids using the buffer as much as possible. \n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Gauntlet's Aera solution to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact. \n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\nFurther details about the ARB conversion strategy and about Aera can be found below in the 'ARB Conversion Strategy' section below.\n\n**Note**: The proposal includes the re-election of the current members of the ADPC. For any future extension terms of the ADPC, the process outlined in the original Tally vote will stand unless automatic renewal of the then-current members is proposed. Of course, this will be subject to the potential OpCo that gets formed and any implications that may have on the structure of the ADPC.\n\n### **Acknowledgements**\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible. We would especially like to thank the security service providers who deeply engaged with the program from the very beginning. We would also like to thank all respondents to the ADPC’s outreach in determining the procurement frameworks to tackle in Phase II, including @bobbay, @JoJo, @Frisson, @realdumbird, @IronBoots, and @krst, among others.\n\n# **II. Background of the ADPC**\n\nThe ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem's governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem's growth, security, and sustainability.\n\nThe inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee's formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum's governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.\n\nPhase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.\n\nThe ADPC’s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:\n\n### **A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nOversee and facilitate the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nResearch and draft a proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services to subsidize the costs for security services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)**\n\nResearch and implement a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized  to assess a project's eligibility for the subsidy fund referred to in paragraph \\[B] above.\n\n### **D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nEstablish procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service types that the Arbitrum DAO could need in the foreseeable future. \n\n### **E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nCreate and communicate guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time.\n\n# **III. Achievements & Progress**\n\nThe ADPC made significant progress against its mandates:\n\n**A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nThe ADPC finalized and [<u>published</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) extensive RFP documentation for whitelisting security service providers on June 19, 2024. This comprehensive framework is designed to establish a marketplace for whitelisted service providers to offer services pursuant to pre-agreed terms, conditions, and pricing to projects that have been granted subsidies under the Security Services Subsidy Fund Proposal.\n\nThe development of the RFP documentation was an intensive, multi-stage process that involved various stakeholders and multiple rounds of refinement. The key stages included: \n\n1. Creating an initial draft that incorporated research on best practices in procurement frameworks and multiple internal drafting sessions;\n2. Working with DeDaub to integrate specific technical requirements into the RFP;\n3. Working with the Arbitrum Foundation’s legal team to align the legal documents with the Foundation’s policies and guidelines;\n4. Conducting a final review by the ADPC, DeDaub, and the Arbitrum Foundation;\n5. Publishing the final documentation.\n\nThis procurement framework, being the first of its kind, set a new standard for procurement processes in the crypto space. \n\nThe RFP received responses from 12 security service providers and the whitelisting of these providers is still in progress. We expect to execute the agreements necessary for enabling engagement in September 2024.\n\n**B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nThe ADPC researched, drafted, and passed a [<u>proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/3552942192106351362095426680857341385146921274641698065112264407057470303359); the development of the proposal was strongly influenced by community engagement, while the terms and conditions for the receipt of the subsidy (’Means Test’) were mainly based on our experience from traditional procurement processes.\n\nThe [<u>initial Subsidy Fund proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) incorporated:\n\n1. A comprehensive benchmarking exercise with 10 leading security audit service providers which was conducted to analyze costs and scope of typical security audits to determine the fund size and allocation;\n2. A detailed evaluation framework with weighted criteria for the ‘Means Test’; and\n3. Timelines and procedures for application submission and review.\n\nFollowing the publication of the initial proposal, the ADPC engaged in extensive community discussions. Key points of feedback included concerns about the large fund size and potential for inefficient capital allocation and questions about the capacity to manage such a large fund. \n\nIn response to community feedback, the ADPC revised the proposal. In particular, the subsidy fund was reduced to $2.5 million worth of ARB (75% reduction) to potentially fund up to 12 projects for one cohort of 8 weeks and with a maximum subsidy per project of $250K (10% of the total fund). \n\nThe ADPC also listened to and incorporated community feedback about the ADPC managing the initial subsidy fund itself. As a consequence, the ADPC translated raised community concerns into a concrete governance proposal to create a separate “[<u>Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-Committee</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766)”, consisting of five members elected through a weighted voting system with a proposed compensation of 60,000 ARB in total. However, after thorough discussion, the community voted against the creation of the sub-committee, leaving the disbursement of funds under the subsidy fund to the ADPC.\n\n**C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)**\n\nThe [<u>Means Test</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) and the related [<u>Grant Application T\\&Cs</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view) were uniquely developed for Arbitrum DAO as a structured approach to evaluate applications for financial assistance. The primary goal of the Means Test is to identify applicants who would benefit most from support with the potential for significant positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem while (i) ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem and (ii) preventing exploitation by larger players.\n\nFor this assessment, we:\n\n1. Developed a scoring system with a 1-5 rating scale and assigned weights to criteria based on importance. \n2. Developed four main criteria categories, each with weighted sub-criteria: Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution, Business Model & Need for the Subsidy, Financial Analysis and a Risk Analysis. \n3. Based on community feedback, we further identified key verticals that are particularly valuable to the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n4. Implemented a two-stage evaluation process, with an initial screening focused on the five highest-weighted sub-criteria before conducting an in-depth review with a comprehensive evaluation of all criteria for top-scoring applicants.\n\n \n\n**D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nWhile our primary efforts were focused, due to the complexity of the undertaking and the high level of community engagement and input, on the oversight of the security-oriented service providers framework, the research and proposal of the subsidy fund, the development of the eligibility framework ('Means Test') and the creation and communication of guidance, we did conduct work to identify and prioritize potential verticals for future procurement frameworks. Our approach was to create a comprehensive and adaptable methodology that could be applied to various service categories, ensuring that future frameworks would be developed with a robust approach.\n\nMore detail about our exploration into future procurement frameworks can be found in the section on [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) below.\n\n**E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nThe ADPC achieved its goal of keeping the community abreast of its activities and progress during the entirety of its first phase by:\n\n1\\. Setting up a bi-weekly 1 hour call on the Arbitrum governance calendar to engage with delegates and community members;\n\n2\\. Establishing a [<u>dedicated dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21) including the Meeting Minutes of each week’s internal ADPC standing meeting and the ADPC’s current task list;\n\n3\\. Creating a [<u>dedicated Telegram channel</u>](https://t.me/+lyn8LCx7_3U5NTU0) to communicate with RFP applicants;\n\n4\\. Scheduling two AMA sessions to field and answer queries from RFP applicants; and\n\n5\\. Publishing a [<u>forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) explaining how the entire Procurement Framework operates.\n\n# **IV. Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I**\n\nA comprehensive set of learnings and recommendations can be found in the [<u>ADPC’s Phase I Outcome Report</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as). A subset of the most important of these learnings that we will implement in Phase II are:\n\n**Financial Management & Budgeting**\n\nGiven the nature of this initial phase being a pilot, the budget for Phase I was more ‘experimental’, and thus did not fully account for all necessary resources. As such, this proposal will include a comprehensive budget plan and management that:\n\n* Creates a fit-for-purpose budget model based on data collected during Phase I; this model is further explained in the [<u>Budget & Methodology</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below;\n* Bakes in Operating Expenses to account for unexpected challenges and opportunities;\n* Allocates budget for specialized external consultants to address complex issues efficiently (such as DeDaub in Phase I); and\n* Increases the number of FTE personnel to adequately cover all aspects of the ADPC's mandate.\n\n**Clear Alignment with Arbitrum Foundation**\n\nTo improve effective coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation, in Phase II we will:\n\n* Designate specific points of contact within both the ADPC and the Arbitrum Foundation for different areas of collaboration (e.g., legal, technical, strategic). As needed, the points of contact will be with the DAO Relations team;\n* Establish regular check-in meetings between the ADPC and Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Implement a clear escalation path for urgent matters or deadlocks;\n* Develop a mechanism for early Foundation review of legal frameworks;\n* Coordinate timelines for legal reviews and feedback.\n\n**Create a Long-Term Vision for the ADPC’s Role in Supporting Arbitrum**\n\nAs can be seen in the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below, we have already begun to identify a list of selected procurement frameworks the ADPC can tackle over its next and future phases. To compile this list, we used a comprehensive methodology, involving community feedback and engagement, and took into account current market conditions and need for Arbitrum.\n\nIn Phase II, we will further outline the ADPC’s role in the continued growth of Arbitrum and ensure that it forms an important part of the DAO’s structure going forward, including as a key component of the OpCo.\n\n**Community Engagement & Transparency**\n\nWhile we spent significant time and resources on community engagement and providing regular, detailed updates, this part of our mandate was more time-consuming than anticipated but crucial for the success of initiatives. Key learnings that we will implement in Phase II are to: \n\n* Implement a clear process for incorporating community input into decision-making;\n* Improve the public dashboard to inform better about the ADPC and showing even more information on real-time progress;\n* Develop comprehensive onboarding materials for community members interested in ADPC activities.\n\n# **V. Phase II Mandate**\n\nThe ADPC proposes the following work packages in Phase II:\n\n### **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 Tactical Verticals**\n\n    \n\n**Vertical 1. Procuring RPC Providers**\n\nVertical 1 will be focused on creating a whitelisted panel of RPC providers that can be procured by projects currently building or looking to build on Arbitrum. This panel of RPC providers will enable streamlined access and transparent pricing during the project’s build phase or post-launch, adding to the ecosystem of support services for Arbitrum projects and Orbit chains. \n\n    \n\nWe have chosen this vertical based on discussions with key delegates and stakeholders, given that a key focus for Arbitrum is to grow the Orbit ecosystem, while RPC costs are relatively high and RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits. Moreover, the technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a huge time suck for projects. Pre-vetting RPC providers would make it much more attractive for projects to build on Arbitrum.\n\n    \n\nIn case there is any major opposition to the selection of this vertical, the ADPC will in the first month of Phase II engage with key delegates and stakeholders to arrive at a final decision on the vertical to tackle. The stakeholders we have engaged with have demonstrated an interest in each of the verticals listed below. To find such a substitute vertical, we will:\n\n* Shortlist key stakeholders to schedule calls with;\n* Liaise with the Arbitrum Foundation to identify relevant legal and regulatory considerations associated with these frameworks;\n* Create engagement surveys to be shared with key delegates and projects building on Arbitrum to identify their one prioritized vertical from the below four verticals:\n\n    \n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/6d3da625-529b-4cfb-baa9-4ef39d1cae33_original.png)\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/7cc0015d-e57a-494d-85cc-79855272c3c6_original.png)\n\n    \n\nFor further information on the methodology we used to shortlist these frameworks, see the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below.\n\n**Vertical 2. Procuring Events Providers**\n\nVertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal.\n\n    \n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC, Entropy Advisors will first create an events & sponsorships strategy while, in parallel, event providers will be whitelisted. Second, individual RFP processes will be conducted to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.\n\n    \n\nPlease refer to the “RFP - Establishing a DAO Events Strategy for 2025” proposal for granular detail on how this procurement process will be constructed when it is published in the coming weeks.\n\n**Scope for Work Package 1**\n\nThe scope within the 6-month term is to:\n\n    \n\n1. Develop evaluation criteria;\n2. Draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP / tender);\n3. Evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s.\n4. If need be, research and begin the process of setting up a subsidy fund for the RPC providers vertical (or, if the need arises, a substitute vertical chosen by the DAO). This will include the development and ratification of the Means Test for that specific fund, community engagement and research to determine the size of the fund, drafting a proposal to pass the fund through Arbitrum governance, and if need be, the set-up of a separate sub-committee to manage the fund.\n5. For the Events vertical, conduct individual RFP processes to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel. \n\n    \n\n**Note:**\n\n* Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those external parties.\n* To streamline our financial budget, the management of any subsidy fund other than the legacy subsidy fund for security service providers is not included in this scope. The management of newly formed subsidy funds could be conducted either by a separate sub-committee or by the ADPC (as decided upon by the DAO), and will be subject to an additional management fee which will be included in any extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 2: Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 2**\n\n* The management of the Security Services Subsidy Fund was not part of the ADPC’s mandate in Phase I. However, as decided by the DAO, the ADPC was elected to manage the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund, which we hereby include in the scope for this work package.\n* Communication of key learnings and improvements from the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund.\n* The ADPC will conduct in particular the following tasks to manage the Subsidy Fund (non-exhaustive):\n  * Setting up the infrastructure for running the program;\n  * Defining and executing the marketing strategy;\n  * Scanning inbound applications, filtering for scams/junk, and reviewing each application;\n  * Onboarding of grantees, including a welcome email with acceptance, set up of comms channels, coordinating KYB/KYC, etc.\n  * Setting milestones for funding and progress;\n  * Ensuring milestone alignment with program objectives;\n  * Setting clear project deliverables;\n  * Tracking progress;\n  * Executing funding alongside the Arbitrum Foundation;\n  * Preparing the End-of-Program report;\n  * Act as the point of contact and ‘customer service’ for all grant applicants.\n* Depending on the success of this first iteration, market conditions, and demand from the DAO, the ADPC may propose an extension of the fund for one or more cohorts.\n* Depending on discussions with the community and delegates and learnings from the first iteration of the fund, the ADPC will either propose a separate sub-committee to manage the fund or will propose to manage the next iteration of the fund itself. Both of these options will require additional fund management costs which will be included in any Subsidy Fund extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 3: Creation of OpEx (Operational Expense) Budget for the DAO to Utilize Whitelisted Service Providers**\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO currently faces significant inefficiencies in its ability to engage with service providers, particularly those whitelisted by the ADPC. Presently, any effort to solicit services, such as a security audit, requires the DAO to navigate the entire governance proposal life cycle — a process that can extend over a month for just a single deliverable. This protracted timeline not only delays critical operations but also impedes the DAO's ability to respond swiftly to emerging needs, creating a bottleneck that hinders operational efficiency.\n\nTo address these inefficiencies and better equip the DAO for future needs, we will propose the establishment of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget. This budget is designed to streamline the DAO’s interaction with ADPC-whitelisted service providers by creating a direct utilization rail. This rail will allow DAO initiatives and contributors to access and utilize these pre-approved service providers without undergoing the cumbersome proposal process for each engagement. The OpEx budget essentially bypasses the bureaucratic hurdles that currently plague the DAO’s procurement process, enabling a more agile and responsive operational framework.\n\nThe OpEx budget will be initially administered by the Multi-Signature Service (MSS), ensuring that funds are allocated specifically for the utilization of ADPC-whitelisted service providers. The ADPC will draft the initial proposal for the OpEx budget, which will include detailed guidelines on its usage. Importantly, while the ADPC will establish the budget, it will not have control over its management or the approval of expenditures, thus maintaining a clear separation of duties and preserving DAO oversight.\n\n**Why is an OpEx Budget Needed?**\n\nCurrently, the DAO’s engagement with service providers is hampered by a rigid and time-consuming process that involves submitting a governance proposal, conducting a Snapshot temperature check, and finally, holding an on-chain vote. This multi-step process is not only inefficient but also stifles the DAO’s ability to procure services in a timely manner, particularly in scenarios requiring quick action. By introducing an OpEx budget, we aim to eliminate these bureaucratic barriers, creating a streamlined pathway for the DAO to access necessary services from ADPC-whitelisted providers.\n\nMoreover, the OpEx budget is not just a temporary fix; it is a strategic initiative designed to future-proof the DAO’s operations. As the DAO evolves, the OpEx budget can be seamlessly integrated into future organizational structures, such as the prospective OpCo, which has been under discussion. By establishing this budget now, the DAO ensures it has a ready-made, adaptable infrastructure in place to meet its future operational needs. This forward-thinking approach not only addresses current inefficiencies but also lays the foundation for a more resilient and responsive organizational framework.\n\n**Key Aspects of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Funding Allocation**: The amount allocated to the OpEx budget will be determined through a governance vote, with the ADPC providing multiple options for consideration. The funds will be held in the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) set up by Entropy Advisors, dedicated exclusively to services procured through the ADPC’s whitelisted providers.\n2. **Effective Utilization**: The proposal will outline the procedures for the DAO to efficiently utilize the OpEx budget, ensuring that all expenditures are subject to appropriate oversight while still allowing for the flexibility needed to address immediate operational needs.\n\n**Benefits of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Immediate Access**: The OpEx budget will enable the Arbitrum DAO to quickly and efficiently engage with service providers without the delays imposed by the current governance process.\n2. **Foundation for Future Operations**: This initiative serves as a foundational step toward future-proofing the DAO’s operations. By establishing relationships with service providers now, the DAO will be better positioned to transition into more complex organizational structures in the future, with an established operational framework already in place.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of an OpEx budget addresses the current inefficiencies in the DAO’s procurement process by providing a streamlined mechanism for engaging with service providers. It also future-proofs the DAO by laying the groundwork for its evolving operational needs, ensuring that the DAO can continue to operate efficiently and effectively as it grows and adapts.\n\n### **Work Package 4: Outcome Report, Definition of ADPC Vision and Role, and Ad-Hoc Tasks**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have [<u>published for Phase I</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as), to be submitted to the DAO. The Outcome Report will consist of:\n  * Achievements and Progress from Phase II;\n  * Financial Overview;\n  * Overview of Community Engagement;\n  * Challenges;\n  * Key Learnings & Recommendations;\n  * Outlook.\n* Continued definition of ADPC vision and role in the DAO:\n  * The DAO is currently in the process of determining its ways of working and operational structure for the short and long-terms. There have been extensive discussions among key delegates and community members around the set-up of an OpCo, and Areta has (tentatively) defined how the ADPC could fit into such a structure in the [<u>final report for the M\\&A Pilot Phase</u>](https://docsend.com/view/wc4cackddrbfe35h).\n  * As such, as part of the ADPC, we commit to continually align with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits cleanly into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n  * Executing on ad-hoc tasks such as aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n### **Optional Additional Verticals: Procurement for Up to \\[2] Additional Verticals Depending on the Completion of Work Package 1**\n\n**Scope of Optional Additional Verticals**\n\nOn completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval and approved by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks. \n\nWe are leaving some flexibility in this Work Package given the pace of change in the DAO and the broader crypto market, and recognize that the DAO’s needs and wants will likely change over time. \n\n**Note:** This work package will likely be subject to the ADPC requiring additional funding since this Phase II proposal is based on conducting procurement for two verticals. If the need for additional funding to conduct procurement for these further verticalsarises, the ADPC will approach the DAO with further details about budget and scope.\n\n# **VI. Budget & Methodology**\n\n### **Budget Components**\n\n**Phase II Budget**\n\nAs outlined in the [<u>Phase I Outcome Report </u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as)and the section on [<u>Key Learnings & Improvements</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) from Phase I above, the actual work in the ADPC was significantly more time intensive than priced-in, but taken on by the committee as goodwill in the pilot phase. Since we have now left the pilot phase and will provide procurement services for two verticals in Work Package 1, the budget naturally reflects this.\n\n**The ADPC is budgeting USD 360,000 for the work in Phase II as outlined in the Phase II Mandate section above.**\n\nIn Phase II, the ADPC will continue with producing the agreed outputs together with a continuation of management of all legacy programs including the management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Service Providers.\n\n**Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2]**\n\nRegarding the Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2], given the operational effort to set up and run such a fund, as described in Work Package 2 above, we would usually charge a management fee including Operational Expenses as a percentage fee of the value of the fund. \n\nIn this case, however, given that this is the pilot phase for the fund and that all the pre-work to set the fund up including the passing of the Tally vote and liaising with the Arbitrum Foundation has already been completed, we will waive all fees to run the fund in the pilot phase as a sign of our commitment and in order to make it as seamless as possible to prove the success of the fund in this first iteration.\n\nThis fee waiver only applies to the current proposal. If there is an extension to the Subsidy Fund in the future, management fees will be included in the respective proposal.\n\n**Operational Expenses Budget**\n\nPhase I highlighted the importance of including operational expenses in the budget: This is necessary to engage external subject matter experts - as we did with [<u>DeDaub in Phase I</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526)  - and cover operational expenses such as third party communication tools and collaboration infrastructure.\n\nTo take this into account, we propose an additional budget of 15% Operational Expenses which will be allocated for the engagement of SMEs and for other operational expenses and running costs. The Operational Expenses budget includes (non-exhaustive):\n\n* Infrastructure set-up for essential tools and infrastructure like centralized accounts for email, collaboration platforms, and document management systems;\n* Implementing comprehensive document retention and IP management policies;\n* Creating standardized templates and workflows for common processes;\n* Allocation of budget for specialized external SMEs to address complex issues efficiently;\n* Budget flexibility to accommodate unexpected challenges and community engagement needs.\n\nThe remaining unused funds of this sub-budget will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after Phase II has been concluded.\n\n**The Operational Expenses Budget for Phase II will total USD 54,000.**\n\n**ARB Token Calculation**\n\nTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on Thu Sep 19 on CoinGecko ([<u>https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical\\_data</u>](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data)), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility. We'll add a 20% buffer to this amount to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after the conversion has been concluded.\n\n### **Total Budget**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/4a89fd32-67ef-4286-a857-9c946ad16b25_original.png)\n\nThe total budget requested is 954,608 ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB Amount [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwv3ljCRbZfQFJHeam_HaE5bSu1d-wIGyv0YUj2b7RA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\nA detailed breakdown of the budget can be found in the Google sheet [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqsCoVu8ykQ3QOr1IMPiMG1lhP-qHYGnXl_OqOP3eBQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n# **VII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II**\n\n### **Methodology**\n\nIn order to identify the verticals that will be most beneficial for the ADPC to tackle in Phase II, we created a non-weighted scoring system to rate all verticals against the following factors:\n\n**Importance to Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis factor takes into account the importance of the vertical with respect to the following criteria:  \n\n* Frequency of use of the vertical by Projects;  \n* Estimated spend under the vertical; \n* Feedback from Arbitrum stakeholders regarding importance of vertical to Arbitrum ecosystem growth; and \n* The extent to which the Procurement Framework (PF) vertical helps make the process of building on Arbitrum, both for existing and new projects, more streamlined, cost-effective, and attractive, while simplifying and standardizing their engagement with service providers.   \n\nHigher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Importance to DAO Proposals & Initiatives**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by existing DAO proposals and initiatives, helps operationalize them, and increases their chances of success. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Solving Existing DAO Needs**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by the DAO in general, and how significantly the PF will help professionalize and operationalize the DAO further. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of utility to the DAO.\n\n**Overlap with Existing DAO Initiatives / Structure**\n\nThere are initiatives in the DAO or from the Foundation that are already tackling the problem solved by the PF. The ranking will take into account how well the PF vertical avoids overlap/duplication. Higher scores indicate PF is better at avoiding overlap/duplication.\n\n**Procurement Complexity / Cost**\n\nThe complexity of constructing the procurement framework and the cost to do so. Higher ratings indicate lower complexity.\n\n**Monetary Savings for Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for projects on Arbitrum resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Monetary Savings for DAO**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for the DAO resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Increase in Deployment Efficiency**\n\nThis criterion evaluates the extent to which an introduction of the PF makes deployment for new projects more efficient.  The greater the efficiency improvements, the higher the rating.\n\nEach of these factors are rated on a scale of 0 (Not Applicable at All), 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High), and higher scores are better.\n\n**Note:** Some of these factors are not applicable to some verticals. As such, the final score for each vertical is the percentage it has achieved, to enable comparability between verticals. For example, if the Events vertical has 6 factors that are applicable to it, the maximum score it can achieve is 18 and its final score is the percentage of the score it has achieved out of 18, so if it has achieved 17, its final score is 94%.\n\n**Application of Methodology to Frameworks**\n\nWe identified 27 verticals that we could potentially tackle in Phase II. The below table represents the scores per vertical with the methodology applied, in order from highest to lowest. For a detailed breakdown of the application of the methodology with rationales for each individual score, please see the table [<u>here</u>](https://adpc.notion.site/Application-of-Procurement-Framework-Shortlisting-Methodology-0c35048ce6074195b64afb07277a7887).\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/02a80294-c049-43b9-aace-e9c02b4283f8_original.png)\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n1\\. Events\n\n2\\. Tokenomics & Token Launch Teams\n\n3\\. DevRel Firms\n\n4\\. OTC Services\n\n5\\. KYC Providers\n\n7\\. RPC Providers\n\n**Note:**\n\nWe did not initially include Risk Service Providers in the list of verticals since these were already available to the DAO via the ARDC. As such, we did not ask for specific feedback from delegates and stakeholders for this vertical.\n\nHowever, given that the ARDC may eliminate this function in its next iteration, we decided to include it in our list and, as it scored very highly, include it in the list of verticals to potentially tackle in Phase II.\n\n**Community Engagement & Feedback Collection**\n\nAfter shortlisting the top six verticals, we decided to validate the shortlisted verticals with high-context delegates, existing Arbitrum projects, and new projects aiming to build on Arbitrum. The intention was to further narrow down the verticals to the two we would tackle in Phase II.\n\n**We reached out to 25 stakeholders for feedback:** L2Beat, Coinflip, GMX, DK, Gauntlet, Wintermute, Griff Green, Blockworks, Frisson, JoJo, Jones DAO, Pepperoni Jo3, Treasure, Camelot, Cattin, Premia, MUX Protocol, MaxLomu, Bob Rossi, Karpatkey, Princeton Blockchain Club, Bobbay, Angle Protocol, Merkl, and PaperImperium. \n\nBased on our interactions with the community, we decided to move forward with the procurement of RPC providers as the first vertical. This is because RPC costs are high, RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits, and technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a complex task that drains time and resources from projects. As such, creating a panel of whitelisted RPC providers streamlines the building process for projects.\n\nIn addition, we locked in 'Events' as a second vertical. The reason for this is that we spoke with Entropy Advisors about the need for a coherent events strategy for Arbitrum DAO, which is also apparent from the multiple concurrent events proposals being proposed in the DAO. As a result, we decided to create a proposal alongside Entropy Advisors and DisruptionJoe to establish a DAO Events Strategy for 2025, which will be published soon. While the proposal on the DAO Events Strategy for 2025 is focused on defining in particular the type and distribution of events as a first step, event services and event providers have to be procured in a second step to execute on the identified strategy. This second step, i.e., the provision of those procurement services for the identified events, is the subject of this proposal.\n\n# **VIII. Transparency & Community Engagement**\n\nAs in Phase I, the ADPC commits to maintaining its high standards of transparency and community engagement. We will:\n\n* Continue to hold bi-weekly calls with the entire Arbitrum community, and when need be, make this more frequent;\n* Continue to update the [<u>ADPC Update Thread</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-update-thread/23361/17) on the forum;\n* Post all meeting minutes and tasks on the [<u>ADPC’s public dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21), with a view to further enhancing the dashboard to provide even more information to the community.\n\n# **IX. Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that Phase II of the ADPC’s term will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>Procurement Committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n* **Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.    \n\n* **Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n* **Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n* **Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n* **Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n* **Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n# **X. Multi-Sig**\n\nWe propose to use the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) for Arbitrum DAO. Accordingly, we have taken advantage of the cost savings associated with that service and not included any costs for multi-sig management in this proposal.\n\n# **XI. ARB Conversion Strategy**\n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modeling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact. \n\n<img height=\"224\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQxe5D3NtHl5v6Wou02HlHACIwotU2tGTArqxNZuGkWbR8uUVIxbAQ-yXSUosrPR1yM7c_vySCWpKw9fNpoOa_es889iABvcjDIR7bDCZy6uGkryUxRxhT3z_ezACJRq7b93HDA_Wd_dvwGQNJeg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n**Protocol-Owned Execution**\n\nThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading. Based on current market conditions, it will take \\< 1 week to swap out of 414k USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.\n\nFor ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver). \n\nPassive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and [<u>more</u>](https://www.odos.xyz/about)). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.\n\n<img height=\"136\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKC1Yctsz4n_8hLKl-wNVswcDK9GYigoLIlARP8UpLN-J3y62mwBX1hO0GKANfJg9-nmRuoU_BeiDoBtAUqv7rVO5V4fCppLp8rHS0J7DhZBjSms7o1L5kbGzt5AaBY-9Hq1jbrpaI8m44sNw_dg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\nActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximize liquidity sourcing. Price impact modeling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.\n\nIntraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.\n\n<img height=\"444\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXebyP8Y0LelurvdX7559Y_lsZqAnZg_565TKi3V1iHy4TIeQuPPqURp6T5Loep2wPouHfhTYulL9dmhhutDrK-3f9amiQiDVBZNTmhVA60EpYhQ9DNPJWnETdNZhy1z6BfcuhEutie9KH19RxJAyw?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers*.\n\n<img height=\"419\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFOAHkefe0TGds3Ku642E3FP5jJCHgwcKvnPeKZs1SRZ9l8sUsEF_ofR0AqIimpxCXH-k54FpG1-c49tF0Tw1mT2SfCeK2PmrecejJYEBjiqE42TTLye_LAVepSVTW2uvUngNXlNPqv91_oEftAA?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.*\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n* Chain: Arbitrum\n* Vault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0)\n* Guardian: Gauntlet\n* Tokens: ARB, USDC\n* Protocols: Odos, Bebop, Llamapay\n* Strategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimizing market impact\n* Payment Stream: streamed continuously over 6 months once the swap from ARB to USDC is complete\n* Fee: 0%\n\n### **ADPC Members Payment Process**\n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\n### **About Aera**\n\nAera is an on-chain solution to optimize DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.\n\nTo address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.\n\nYou can read more about Aera [<u>here</u>](https://docs.aera.finance/).",

    "description": "# UPDATED - Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum’s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum’s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum’s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum’s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from ArbitrumDAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event’s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon’s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community’s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from the ArbitrumDAO and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a **30 ETH commitment**. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO had previously signalled its support via a [temperature check on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x29c7eb60e1ed122f81aa5f4caeb5d171b27ae644666ad18aece78ff28d7b9245) with a 30 ETH sponsorship for the Attackathon via the Panda Partnerships tier.\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event’s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Multi-Sig Address for DAO Deposit\n\nTo deposit the funds, the Arbitrum DAO can use the following multi-sig address: **0xD4427b312D42191640Ea12c97457636bb807d65e.**\n\nThis multi-sig is a 3/5 MultiSig owned by Immunefi who is contracted on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation to run the Attackathon program.",

    "description": "# [Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget \n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal requests 250 million ARB with the main objective to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to further foster key strategic partnerships. All expenditures will follow The Arbitrum Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals, as detailed in a high level manner [here](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Milestones-Guidance-85e628abdb0640f1a3c280fb26e19934) and [here](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Submission-Guidelines-5250083006c942d1a371ef0a85cd1b24) (these guidelines apply mainly for the Foundation Grant Program, however, it offers insight into what the Foundation looks at when giving strategic grants or establishing strategic partnerships). Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its upcoming annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn line with its mission as laid out in its [bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Arbitrum Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years with the intention to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership’s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers (as of June 30, 2024)*\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/09ddb4e1-283e-43f6-a2b0-38f42d7edc6e_original.png)The above table provides an overview of The Arbitrum Foundation’s outstanding capital commitments since inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.** The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n* **Pre-agreement offer.** An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.** Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.\n* **Vesting.** The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n* **Capital lockup.** All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request:** **250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.** Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.** Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.\n* **Gateway to DAO.** The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n* **Proven track record.** The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the [2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf) and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it’s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.\n\n### Questions from the DAO\n\nThe Foundation has acknowledged and responded to the questions posted by delegates and DAO contributors on the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775/66), and will continue to respond to questions there.",

    "description": "# ArbitrumDAO strategic “Off-site” (online) updated proposal\n# ArbitrumDAO strategic “Off-site” (online) updated proposal\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Context\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: [ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal 8](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660)\n\nAnd a following proposal where an Online format came on top [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8f242363dbc69d640799b461b27ba7b957ab13af87389b699639ba335b8b5e91)\n\nThe proposal has been streamlined based on feedback and is designed to be independent but compatible with related initiatives such as Alex’s work on coordination and emergent conversations with Disruption Joe, etc. The proposal also stays clear of areas where Entropy is already working and builds upon previous work (e.g. mission and values draft).\n\nThere were concerns about potential overlap with GovHack and we have aligned this initiative so both could be complimentary. However, [the HackHumanity team has announced they won’t be organising an event for Devcon 1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-devcon-in-bangkok-hack-humanity/26634/71).\n\nOffcylce voting: this proposal was planned to be launched on Tally yesterday. Due to some unforeseen coordination around the MSS, we couldn't post until confirming the compliance procedure with the foundation. In the interest of being ableThanksgivingto start this initiative in October and due to multiple constraints in November (DevCon, ThanksGiving), we're posting on Tuesday. Please accept our apologies for any disruption.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates). The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured process will be organized in October (before DevCon), focusing on strategic alignment sessions.\n\nThis proposal includes:\n\n* Stakeholder management (preparation and follow-up): delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to scope and prepare the most important agenda items to be discussed during two online workshops (building upon the survey and analysis already carried out). And post-workshops follow-up on key action items, including snapshot vote to ratify decisions.\n* Facilitation: design and execution of a strategic process to advance alignment, convergence, and prioritization, ensuring clear next steps.\n* Coordination: with Entropy to build on top of the work on mission, vision, and values; and with with additional emergent initiatives (e.g. Joe and Disruption Joe proposal in the works and potential future proposals by HackHumanity and others).\n\nThe key deliverable is an online strategy process to define a shortlist of priorities for the DAO over the next 6 months.\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions. The key outcome is a ratified decision on priorities via Snapshot vote.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. There are many calls, but attendance is not concentrated and the calls are designed for context sharing and informal discussion, not designed for a strategic process. This results in a gap in aigment and clear and explicit strategy, causing slow decision-making.\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. Beyond what can be achieved in an event, these areas require multiple steps of aligment on frameworks and approaches, sense-making, structured deliberation, and ratifying decisions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Output:**\n\nDraft of DAO priorities for the next 6 months that’s put to a Snapshot vote.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe priorities provide alignment and enable the whole community to rally around key priorities, unblocking the DAO.\n\n**The proposal includes:**\n\\*The exact format will be refined during phase 1 in coordination with other initiatives and delegates.\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event alignment) and sense-making.\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the exact agenda and framework.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format. This is a continuation of the work started in December with the pre-proposal for a strategy framework.\n\n1. Strategy Sprint: 2 week process combining live and asynchronous components to integrate broad community input and feedback, deep dives by representative stakeholders, and converging towards a clear list.\n\n* Onboarding participants into the framework and using a collective intelligence tool to generate and organise an initial list of priorities. (asynchronous, 1h)\n* Online workshops to review the initial list, carry a root cause analysis, and argue pros/cons of different priorities. (live, half day)\n* Sharing publicly for community feedback (forum) and our team synthesising feedback.\n* second survey (usign the collective intelligence tool) to collect, cluster, and prioritise a refined list of priorities.

    "description": "# [Non-Constitutional] Arbitrum DAO Delegate Incentive Program\n## [](#p-57276-last-update-02102024-1)Last update: 02/10/2024\n\n*This proposal has been updated based on feedback from delegates provided in this thread during the two calls we organized, as well as through discussions in the delegates’ Telegram group and private contributions from several delegates. We would like to thank the entire ArbitrumDAO community for their valuable input.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-tldr-2)TL;DR\n\n* Expand the program by introducing a new and improved version, **to be implemented over the course of a year.**\n* We propose a total budget of USD 4.2 million (in a year) in delegate incentives, **with a maximum monthly compensation of 7000 USD or 16,500 ARB per month per delegate.**\n* **Creating Delegates’ compensation tiers:**\n  * **Tier 3:** TP ≥ 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n  * **Tier 2:** TP ≥ 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n  * **Tier 1:** TP ≥ 85%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n* **Elimination of the special multisig**, the DIP adheres to the [MSS](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4f6f6c1ba11de1122d5d5b8b098999610920fdc9c61a5e775ea09fbb4bdffc1b)\n* The DAO can cancel the program or modify parameters, such as the scoring methodology, through a Snapshot vote.\n* **Min threshold requirement change:** Participation Rate (Karma) ≥ 75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days. Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n* **Soft enforcement for DAO’s social agreements:** Each delegate must adhere to and comply with all social agreements reached through Snapshot in order to receive incentives.\n* Adding the possibility of **revoking DIP Ban** via Snapshot vote and also creating the **DIP Suspension.**\n* **Delegates’ Feedback Update:** The DAO has [opted](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1326cb522a74b29fb12d52bb302b245180c2b8f6e1fe8f295c4447bd96a5bacd) for v1.5 of the DIP, so a new rubric will be applied to evaluate the feedback given by the delegates in the diverse discussions. Due to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n* **Note that everything related to** [DIP 1.0](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157) **that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.**\n* **Scoring Weight Changes**:\n  * **Participation Rate (PR):** Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR)**: The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n  * **Delegates’ Feedback (DF):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n  * **Total Participation (TP):** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n  * **Bonus points update:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attends to the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).”\n    * For the monthly call, 2,5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n    * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n\n# [](#p-57276-abstract-3)Abstract\n\nWe propose renewing the ArbitrumDAO Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) for one year. This renewal will include adjustments to the parameters, requirements, budget, and incentives awarded to delegates.\n\n# [](#p-57276-motivation-4)Motivation\n\nWe’ve reached the [fifth month of the current version](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-july-2024/26098) of the incentive program, which ends on August 31.\n\nAs outlined in the [mid-term report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671), the program has positively impacted ArbitrumDAO during the first three months.\n\nHowever, simply renewing the program will not generate enough value. Therefore, we propose adjustments to improve the program and increase its impact on ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThese changes are based on our experience as administrators, the reports we’ve conducted, and feedback from delegates, the Karma team, and key community members.\n\n**Note:** *SEEDGov delivered the end-term report, you can check it* [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982)*.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-strengthening-dips-mission-vision-5)Strengthening DIP’s Mission & Vision\n\nAs we mentioned in the [report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048), it is crucial to keep delegated voting power active within ArbitrumDAO. We believe the Incentive Program should focus on the professionalization of delegates.\n\nBy professionalization, delegates should dedicate a significant amount of time to staying informed about developments in ArbitrumDAO, gaining knowledge of Arbitrum’s technology, and making meaningful contributions to the DAO. This includes active participation in most DAO activities like providing feedback on proposals, attending to Governance Calls, maintaining high voting participation on Snapshot and Tally, and providing a rationale for such votes.\n\nTo achieve this, we also need to establish transparent and predictable incentives. Delegates should be confident that if they align with the DAO and improve their contributions over time—essentially if they professionalize—they will receive better incentives. These incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount. Delegates should focus on their role and DAO activities, not on understanding complex economic mechanisms to receive compensation.\n\nWe want delegates to be motivated to participate actively in ArbitrumDAO. In order to do this, incentives must be attractive enough for them to either participate directly or hire competent individuals to represent their interests, those of their community, or their protocol.\n\nIt’s important to note that while managing the incentive program, we realized that it doesn’t address all the challenges faced by the DAO, such as vote distribution, attracting new contributors, and other aspects. Expecting a single strategy to tackle all issues overlooks the diversity of factors involved. However, we’re pleased to see initiatives like [ARB Staking](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084), [(Re)delegation Week](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-is-re-delegation-week-application-thread/25262/26), and the [Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement Pool](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/1) are underway to address these challenges. As each initiative matures, we can align them to achieve a more significant collective impact.\n\n# [](#p-57276-general-parameters-6)General parameters\n\nThe proposed changes below are based on the experience we’ve gained while managing the program, the delegates’ feedback during the discussion on this thread, and both reports we made for the DIP 1.0 ([mid-term](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671) report and [final](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982) report).\n\n**If you want to view the parameters of the previous program, click** [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157).\n\n## [](#p-57276-duration-7)Duration\n\nThe program’s first phase lasted six months, as it was designed as an experimental foundation. For this iteration, extending the duration to twelve months is appropriate, providing greater predictability and flexibility for implementing future changes.\n\n**ArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through an instantaneous vote.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-requirements-to-participate-in-the-dip-8)Requirements to Participate in the DIP\n\nThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:\n\n* Each delegate must adhere to all social agreements reached through Snapshot, including those outlined in proposals such as ‘[Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b),’ ‘[Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db)?,’ ‘[Incentives Detox Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x99b57df3577e8e6561f3549b057bd87fdb7e66f65a7c45fddf63d9cd62f993d8),’ and any other proposals or codes of conduct that may be approved in the future.\n* **Voting Power: >50K ARB, corresponding to 176 delegates.** (Source: [Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n  * **Change:** This parameter will remain unchanged.\n  * **Motivation:** Currently, only 30% of delegates meeting this requirement are part of the program. One of our goals for this renewal is to increase the number of participating delegates.\n* **Participation Rate (Karma): ≥75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days.**\n  * **Change:** Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n  * **Motivation:** As the number of proposals grows, the impact of each individual vote decreases, making it challenging to meet the historical 25% PR. This change aims to lower the barrier for new participants, ensuring that all delegates, regardless of when they joined Arbitrum, are recognized for their consistency and active participation in the DAO. In this way, the program’s approach encourages the active participation of delegates, ensuring a more accurate and up-to-date representation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-onboarding-new-delegates-9)Onboarding new delegates\n\n*A new delegate, without prior participation history, can join the program starting in the third month after casting his first on-chain vote, as long as he meets the specified requirements (>50k voting power and ≥75% participation in on-chain votes) during that third month.*\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2d74f7ff92612525b1bd8a4b822d56642337323f_2_690x428.png)\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-10)Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates who meet the requirements must confirm their participation in the DIP via the [DIP Application Thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945). Delegates can join the program anytime within 12 months, provided they meet the specified criteria. To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up before the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month. **The delegates who have registered for v1.0 will not have to go through this procedure again**\n\n### [](#p-57276-regarding-delegates-kyc-11)Regarding delegates’ KYC\n\nIt is important to mention that it **won’t be necessary** for the delegates already registered to complete the KYC again. They will only need to sign updated agreements with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-template-12)Incentive Program Application Template\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Participation Rate 90 days - Karma (Link):\n\n**Note:** *Any delegate who chooses to withdraw from the program can indicate their intention to opt out by posting a message in the forum.*\n\n## [](#p-57276-number-of-delegates-to-receive-incentives-13)Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-budget-14)Incentive Budget\n\n**Budget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).**\n\n### [](#p-57276-making-the-incentives-more-predictable-15)Making the incentives more predictable\n\nIn the initial iteration of the DIP, costs were denominated solely in ARB, which led to challenges due to the token’s [volatility](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-backed-vaults-risk-analysis/26192).\n\nWhen the program launched in March, the token was valued at approximately USD 1.70, allowing a delegate with 100% Total Participation (TP) to earn around USD 8,500 per month. However, now, in the fifth month of the program, the token is valued at USD 0.55, reducing a delegate’s maximum monthly compensation to about USD 2,750—a decrease of over 60% for the same amount of work. This significant reduction could disincentivize delegate participation.\n\nThe same issue applies to operational, development, and maintenance costs, which have become increasingly misaligned.\n\nTo avoid this situation, we propose that payments be denominated in USD **and made in ARB tokens**. Again, the delegates’ incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount.\n\nIf we want to professionalize DAO operations as much as possible and stay aligned we should aim for delegates to have a certain seniority and dedication to Bringing Value to Arbitrum DAO. Thus, delegates who meet the requirements at the end of the month and achieve a TP of at least 65% will be eligible to receive up to 7,000 USD in ARB tokens as compensation.\n\nNow, as program administrators, our goal is to create the necessary incentives to elevate the overall quality of contributions. During the first iteration of the DIP, we observed that the compensation for top delegates did not significantly differ from those with lower Total Participation (TP) scores. To address this, we propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.\n\n* **Tier 3:** TP ≥ 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n* **Tier 2:** TP ≥ 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n* **Tier 1:** TP ≥ 85% and \\< 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n\nThis approach makes the program more cost-effective per USD spent because as the quality of contributions increases, more resources are allocated to higher-performing delegates (those in tiers 1 and 2). Conversely, if delegate performance is suboptimal, fewer resources are allocated, with more delegates falling into tiers 2 and 3.\n\nWe considered the volatility of the ARB token by suggesting an ARB cap for each Tier. In this way, while delegates’ compensation could still be affected after a drastic price drop, we would at the same time protect the DAO’s interests by limiting its “loss” somewhat. It also act as a mechanism to align delegates with Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Note:** *ARB Cap for each Tier **includes a 30% buffer**.*\n\nWe’ll provide a simulation of what the payout would look like in 3 different scenarios:\n\n* **1st scenario (base): ARB at $0.55**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d030a4c6c32c6d51fe582b410ab77e7bf38bebe0_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **2nd Scenario: ARB at $0.35**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c7772de483ab320803d0e1074ac0ace0b2232e29_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **3rd Scenario: ARB at $1.00**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6d5527d5473ae5488221630857e1bd793933235a_2_602x288.png)\n\n**Note:** *We will use the* [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) *rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.*\n\nAs seen in the images, an increase in ARB’s price would significantly reduce the spending in ARB, allowing the DAO to benefit from the rise. In the other hand, if the price falls to $0.35, the token expenditure of the program is limited to mitigate the DAO’s potential “loss.” This approach also better aligns the program’s USD spending with the DAO’s new economic and financial reality.\n\nAdditionally, the use of tiers in this manner allows for a significant boost in incentives when efforts are increased, acting as a catalyst for delegate activity. The first tier serves as a ‘minimum payment’ for delegates who, for example, fulfill their primary duties: participating in every vote and providing some input in the forum.\n\nTiers 1 and 2 represent the leap in quality, requiring greater effort to obtain 70-100% of the TP, but offering a higher reward in return. A delegate who provides a high degree of dedication and high quality input can DOUBLE the incentives of the lowest tier.\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-conflict-resolution-16)Conflict resolution\n\n### [](#p-57276-dispute-17)Dispute\n\nIf delegates disagree with the results presented by the [Karma Dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) at the beginning of each month, they have a four-day period to contest them.\n\nTo raise a dispute, delegates must post a message in the forum using the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for Dispute (provide details)\n\nThe DIP administrator will address the issue promptly, with a resolution expected within a maximum of 4 days.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-ban-18)DIP Ban\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to expel a delegate if they attempt to game or exploit the program or if the delegate does not meet any of the aforementioned requirements to be considered eligible. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator. In all cases the ban is permanent.\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change (for suspension), or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-suspension-19)DIP Suspension\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to suspend a delegate if he/she/they commits a fault that in the administrator’s judgment is insufficient cause for expulsion. The decision and duration of the suspension are at the discretion of the program administrator (duration can’t exceed the program’s current iteration).\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n## [](#p-57276-scoring-20)Scoring\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the [dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:** *The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3ce736d6381929e586ea2e23db6ca976722c0d83_2_690x322.png)[](#p-57276-new-evaluation-system-for-delegates-feedback-21)**New Evaluation System for Delegates’ Feedback**\n\nWe’ve listened to the concerns raised by some delegates regarding the changes in the Delegates’ Feedback section.\n\nSo, we propose changing the way we collect feedback from a quantitative to a qualitative way.\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. The goal of this system is to:\n\n* Incentivize quality over quantity of feedback.\n* Extend the analysis across all contributions made by a delegate in the forum (instead of only considering those that reach Snapshot).\n* Avoid unnecessary or spam comments made solely to achieve a higher score.\n* Allow delegates to focus on contributing to proposals or discussions related to their areas of expertise.\n\nUnder this system, a delegate could achieve the same score with (for example) one big significant contribution or by making several smaller contributions. It also discourages actors who might try to take advantage of the program.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-evaluation-approach-22)**Evaluation Approach**\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions. The aim is to measure the consistency, quality, and overall impact of their contributions. We expect delegates to comment on and/or provide feedback on proposals and discussions both before and during the voting process. This feedback should aim to foster debate, improve the proposal, or clarify issues not explicitly addressed within it.\n\nWe trust the goodwill of the delegates to avoid meaningless/spam comments and ensure that all contributions are sensible.\n\n* **Key point:** Feedback or opinions that violate [community rules](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidlines/12807) will not be considered. Your interactions should contribute constructively to the discussions and the deliberation and improvement of the proposals.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-rubric-specifications-23)**Rubric Specifications**\n\nThe parameter “Proposal Feedback” should be renamed to \"Delegate’s Feedback” in this case since we’re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8f9ffbb43536c0fd29508d9230235895d8ba9b42_2_602x471.png)\n\nHere is a breakdown of each criterion included in the rubric:\n\n* **Relevance:** Analyzes whether the delegate’s feedback throughout the month is relevant to the discussion.\n* **Depth of Analysis:** It evaluates the depth of analysis provided by the delegate concerning the proposals or discussions. This serves as a metric to assess whether the delegate takes the time to thoroughly meditate on the discussion and demonstrates attention to the details. Key elements include solid arguments, relevant questions, and thorough reasoning.\n* **Timing:** Considers when the delegate provides feedback, rewarding those who provide feedback earlier, as long as they meet the above criteria. Note that feedback will be considered as provided before on-chain/off-chain voting if it was published before the day voting starts at 00:00 UTC.\n* **Clarity and Communication:** this is a review of the clarity, structured communication, and overall readability of the delegate’s feedback. Clear and well-written feedback is rewarded.\n* **Impact on Decision-Making:** While the proposer ultimately decides whether to incorporate feedback, high-quality feedback from a delegate often influences the final proposal that goes to vote. This criterion evaluates whether the delegate’s feedback tends to drive changes in proposals/discussions.\n* **Presence in Discussions:** This is a more quantitative analysis, intended to reflect the effort of delegates who participate in most discussions. This parameter serves as a multiplier to the score obtained across the previous five criteria. Note that the percentage of participation in monthly discussions could be not linear across all DAO’s discussions. Some proposals may carry more weight in the overall discussions (special cases such as LTIPP/STIP, gaming, treasury, etc.).\n\n#### [](#p-57276-monthly-evaluation-process-24)**Monthly Evaluation Process**\n\n**1. Data Collection**: At the end of the month, the complete set of contributions by each delegate across all discussions on the forum is reviewed.\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation:** The rubric is used to assess the delegate’s overall performance on each criterion, based on a holistic view of their participation.\n\n**3. Score Assignment:** A level of 1 to 4 is assigned to each criterion, based on the consistency and quality of the delegate’s contributions over the month. Each level has an assigned score, from 1 to 4.\n\n**4. Monthly Report:** A qualitative and quantitative report summarizing the delegate’s performance over the month is then produced.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-scoring-methodology-25)**Scoring Methodology**\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the “Presence in Discussions” multiplier to the initial average score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, here’s an example:\n\n* Relevance: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n* Depth of Analysis: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Timing: Level 4 - Scoring achieved = 4\n* Clarity and Communication: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Impact on Decision-Making: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n\n**Initial Score/Average: 70% or 14/20 or 2.8/4**\n\n* Participation in Discussions: Level 2 - Multiplier assigned: 1.10x\n\n**Final Score: 70% x 1.1 = 77% or 23.1/30 Delegates’ Feedback points.**\n\n#### [](#p-57276-trade-offs-26)**Trade-offs**\n\nWe are aware that this proposed solution introduces trust assumptions regarding the Program Administrator’s criteria for evaluating feedback. We view this layer of subjectivity as inevitable until we can implement automated tools, such as the AI that Karma is developing, to assess the quality of delegate feedback. It is important to note that, as Program Administrators, after analyzing proposals and feedback for the last six months, we have gained experience that (we believe) will help us correctly identify constructive feedback.\n\nAt SEEDGov, we are committed to being as transparent as possible, as we have been thus far. Therefore, the rubric and the monthly report will always be publicly accessible to all interested parties. During this phase, feedback from Arbitrum DAO will also be crucial in helping us refine our evaluation criteria.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-next-steps-regarding-feedback-27)**Next steps regarding Feedback**\n\nDuring the first iteration of this delegate program, we have been closely monitoring forum activity, particularly during the feedback stage of various proposals. As this phase was a trial, we primarily focused on observing certain dynamics within the forum to better understand them and make adjustments for the next iteration.\n\nOne of the issues we identified is the use of AI to comment on proposals. While the use of AI for tasks such as translating text or correcting grammatical errors is understandable, we have seen instances where it has been employed to generate feedback based on other users’ comments. This has not been a widespread or alarming issue but, in the next iteration, we plan to take a more reactive approach.\n\nAnother issue we have encountered is regarding users who post “Reserved for later comment.” We want to clarify that we do not recommend or encourage such practices, which should preferably be avoided.\n\nIn this iteration, we will try to provide feedback to delegates on this type of situation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-experimental-nature-of-the-new-delegates-feedback-scoring-system-28)Experimental nature of the new delegates’ feedback scoring system.\n\nDue to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n\n### [](#p-57276-scoring-weight-changes-29)Scoring Weight Changes\n\nAfter observing delegate behavior and some internal discussions, we believe it is necessary to adjust specific parameters of the program:\n\n**Participation Rate (PR)**\n\n* **Change**: Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n* **Motivation:** The 90-day participation rate is a requirement for delegates to register in the program. Unlike the historical rate, this parameter is more accessible, so we have decided to lower its weight.\n\n**Snapshot Voting (SV)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n* **Motivation:** Snapshot voting is a crucial part of the governance process. It is essential to give it more weight to encourage delegates to vote in snapshots.\n\n**Communicating Rationale (CR)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n* **Motivation:** While providing a rationale for votes is important, we consider the feedback period even more crucial. Therefore, we have reduced the weight of Communicating Rationale and increased the weight of Delegates’ Feedback.\n\n**Delegates’ Feedback (DF)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n* **Motivation:** Providing feedback on forum proposals is fundamental. We have raised this parameter’s weight above others and introduced a rubric to evaluate the feedback qualitatively. These changes are detailed further above.\n\n**Total Participation (TP)**\n\n* **Change:** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n* **Motivation:** After analyzing the program’s results, we observed that some delegates with high historical participation in Tally could meet the +60% requirement by voting on 100% of monthly proposals. We have decided to raise the TP requirement to +65% for compensation to encourage more contributions in the forum.\n\n**Bonus Point (BP)**\n\n* **Change:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attend the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).”\n  * For the monthly call, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n  * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n* **Motivation**: We have received several questions about delegate participation in calls or working groups. While there is a trend to compensate work within specific WGs (and we want to avoid potential double spending by the DAO), we find it interesting to experiment with the idea of awarding Bonus Points to delegates who participate in both the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46)”. We will continue to manage this parameter as in the previous program. Although it was a topic of discussion, we have yet to receive complaints about how these points were awarded. We welcome any feedback from the DAO.\n\n### [](#p-57276-details-terminology-symbols-and-formulas-30)Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n* **Participation Rate - 90 days (PR90) - Weight 15:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes in the last 90 days.

If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, it’s automatically granted +30% extra TP. This extra is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + DF% + BP**\n* **Payment USD (PUSD)**: The final amount of USD that the delegate will receive is based on his TP% and his Tier.\n  * **PUSD formula: IF(TIER =1; TP/100x7000; IF(TIER=2; TP/85x5100;IF(TIER=3; TP/70x3250;0)))**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** The final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive is based on his PUSD, the ARB Price and the ARB payment cap of the corresponding tier.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(PUSD/ARB Price > Tier’s ARB Cap; Tier’s ARB Cap; (PUSD/ARB Price))**\n\n**Note:** [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lyJQODU-XjhDthfSH5ploJhWfTb5pz7-dHvlxEqstaw/edit?usp=sharing) *is the framework template for delegates to review the parameters.*\n\n### [](#p-57276-parameter-summary-31)Parameter summary\n\n**Activity Weight (%):**\n\n* Participation Rate 90 (PR90) - Weight 15%\n* Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 20%\n* Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%\n* Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 10%\n* Delegates’ Feedback (DF) - Weight 30%\n* Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30%\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n* TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %PF + BP\n\n## [](#p-57276-administrative-budget-32)Administrative Budget\n\nWe have updated the operational costs for administering this new program.

Based on this experience, we anticipate the following work for the upcoming year:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Maintenance and Expenses:** We will continue to ensure that the dashboard operates smoothly, with real-time data updates for most metrics and daily overall calculations. This includes regular software maintenance, such as updating libraries and other necessary tasks to keep the system secure and efficient.\n2. **Ongoing Collaboration with SEEDGov:** Regular calls with the SEEDGov team over the past six months have been instrumental in maintaining the program’s smooth operation. These meetings have allowed us to address bugs, resolve data discrepancies, and implement enhancements based on administrative needs. We will continue these calls to ensure ongoing improvements in operational efficiency.\n3. **Compensation Calculation Logic Updates:** As outlined in the new proposal, we will implement necessary changes to the compensation calculation logic. This includes introducing a tier system, adjusting weights and metrics, and incorporating a 90-day calculation period.\n4. **Automation of Voting Statistics:** Our current system fully automates voting statistics, streamlining the process for admins to determine compensation. Collecting data on Communication Rationale and Proposal Feedback has historically been time-consuming. A few months ago, we introduced an MVP that automates this process using LLM tools. We plan to continue enhancing this feature to further assist administrators.\n5. **Verification of Statistics:** All statistics need to be verified for accuracy in a timely manner, specifically by the first of each month.

    "description": "# Fund the Stylus Sprint\n**TLDR of changes made since Snapshot:**\n\n* **Additional Evaluation Committee Members:** SEEDGov and JoJo have agreed to join the evaluation committee.\n* **Soft Request “Cap”:** Language was added to specify a soft request “cap” of 500k ARB (10% of the program budget), which is dependent on the total ARB requested in the program. Applicants requesting greater than 500k ARB may be sent to the DAO directly.\n* **MSS-controlled multi-sig:** Additional clarification has been added that funds will be managed by a MSS controlled multi-sig along with Entropy Advisors acting in an “approver” role to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n* **Flexibility in Milestone Structure:** Language has been revised to allow applicants to propose their own milestone structure.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed and executed, activating Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time “Stylus Sprint” program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks with a 2 week review period and program length of 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign’s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.\n\nThe “Stylus Sprint” is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus’ transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.\n\n[Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970) represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum’s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.\n\nThe “Stylus Sprint” will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem’s staying power.\n\nThe Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. Demonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus’ efficiency and compute advantages.\n2. Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.\n3. Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus’ efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.\n4. Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.\n5. Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.\n6. Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nFor the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:\n\n* New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;\n* New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;\n* External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);\n* Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).\n\nFor the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:\n\n* Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:\n* [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html) - a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/).\n* [Move ](https://move-language.github.io/move/)- a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.\n* A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the [Stylus cache manager](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-cache-manager) on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:\n  * How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;\n  * How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;\n  * How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;\n  * How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;\n  * How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).\n* A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.\n* General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.\n* General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.\n* Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.\n* Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help [CosmWASM](https://cosmwasm.com/) and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. [@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov) and [@JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo) bring extensive experience in DAO grant programs and will help round out the committee with additional perspective/backgrounds.\n\n**Evaluation Committee**\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n4. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. SEEDGov Org (5000 ARB per month)\n6. JoJo (5000 ARB per month)\n7. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe committee will work collaboratively to provide feedback and access applications. In the event of a equally split opinion, the Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the tie-breaking opinion.\n\n**Committee Advisors**\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months, with the Stylus Sprint expected to begin in November 2024 and conclude mid-January 2026. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 8 weeks will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program. These updates will be posted to a dedicated Stylus Sprint forum channel.\n\n### Recommended Application Structure and Framing\n\nApplications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:\n\n* What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;\n* How closely the team’s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;\n* Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;\n* An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;\n* A reasonable development plan and timeline.\n\nJudges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.\n\nThe recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria.\n\nQuestbook will be utilized for hosting the Stylus Sprint, accepting/rejecting applications, and giving public reasoning for the choice.\n\n### Application Evaluation Criteria\n\nWhile we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.\n\nOverall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:\n\n* **Can scale, or help scale**, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.\n* **Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure**, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.\n* **Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term**, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.\n* **Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity**, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.\n* **Fill a specific, unique niche in the market**, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).\n* **Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem** to effectively “grow the pie” of Web3 projects and users.\n\nNote that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program’s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint specific MSS multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program, 300K ARB for payments to judges, and 30k ARB for payment to Questbook. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig.\n\nEntropy Advisors will function in the “approver” role working with the MSS and the Arbitrum Foundation to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones. There is no maximum request amount, but requests over 500k that are deemed quality, have a likelihood of being sent to the DAO instead of included in the program depending on the total ARB requested in the program and quality of the applications. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. The number of checkpoints, percentage of funds unlocked, and criteria for each will be proposed by the applicant. This is to grant additional flexibility as a one size fits all milestone structure is not the best approach given the wide-range of potential applicants and the volatile nature of ARB requests. While the milestone structure is flexible, the evaluation committee will prioritize applicants that backload payment distribution over those that request high percentages upfront.\n\nThe below milestone structure is recommended; however, it is not required:\n\n1. **10% - Planning** + Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.\n2. **40% - Deployment**: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. \\*Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC\n3. **25% - Checkpoint 1**\n4. **25% - Checkpoint 2**\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above.\n\nThe evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Grant Eligibility Requirements\n\n* Grantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experience\n* Grantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use. Free to use however will be a factor in the evaluation committee criteria.\n* Grantees must participate in co-marketing activities to promote their protocol and Stylus.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to judge progress.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees must not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Oct 10th, 2024\n4. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 28, 2024\n5. Open Application Period Begins - Nov 11th, 2024\n6. Open Application Period Ends - Jan 6th, 2025\n7. Application Review Period Ends - Jan 20th, 2025\n   a. 1 year timeline for selected applicants begins\n   b. KYC/Compliance process with the Arbitrum Foundation begins\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis till the end of the Review Period (Jan 20th). Applicants will receive feedback on a first come, first serve basis. Those that apply early will likely have an edge over late applicants who will have less opportunities for feedback. KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation will begin after the review period and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,330,000 ARB**\n\n* Up to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus.\n* 75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 4 committee members = 300,000 ARB. Committee members will be paid in monthly increments of 5000 ARB.\n* 30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

    "description": "# Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure Arbitrum’s continued presence at the industry’s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.\n\nOur proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:\n\n1. Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.\n2. Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Virtual hackathons\n* Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)\n* In-person hackathons\n* Side events\n* Sponsorships of major events\n* Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)\n* Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEvents play a crucial role in strengthening the Arbitrum community and brand, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem, expediting DAO initiatives by facilitating in-person collaboration, and providing avenues for alliance with other partners within the industry. While the Questbook program has done an excellent job in ensuring the Arbitrum brand is represented at smaller conferences across multiple regions, the DAO does not currently have a dedicated plan or budget for events. Larger Arbitrum events, such as Arbitrum Day, are left to the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs to organize. The DAO certainly appreciates what the Foundation and OCL do on the events front, but the DAO should serve a complementary role – which if enabled – will maximize Arbitrum’s overall ability to grow a healthy ecosystem and capture network effects in our speed and flexibility for deployment.\n\nThere is significant value in aligning on the scope/timing of hackathons, GovHack-type events, and major events presence (such as EthCC, DevCon, etc). For example, Stylus represents one of the most significant software upgrades in Arbitrum’s history – it could be wise for the DAO to ensure a Stylus-focused hackathon is planned for 2025 in an effort to bring more developers into our ecosystem and to improve dev tooling/infra. In addition to ecosystem events, it is very important for delegates to meet up in person at a regular cadence. We see how much more we can accomplish in-person time and time again, and we believe the DAO could formulate and execute on a grander strategy if these delegate offsites were formally planned/coordinated.\n\nHosting events requires substantial upfront time and capital, typically involving 4-6 months of planning and $25-100k in down payments for venues, travel, accommodations, catering, and other expenses. Planning and funding events on a case-by-case basis are impractical due to the lead time and the lengthy DAO voting process. Recently, the DAO [approved](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730) $309k to host an event at EthCC in Brussels. However, the proposal was not executed on-chain until approximately five weeks before the event. Hack Humanity, the entity behind the GovHack event, took on substantial risk by using its funds to secure a venue, caterers, and other necessities without a guarantee of DAO funding. Although Hack Humanity felt comfortable taking this risk due to previous collaboration with the DAO and assistance from Entropy Advisors, this upfront financial burden should not fall on service providers in the future. One off RFP processes would enable organizers to plan higher-quality events with the extra time & budget provided. Alternatively, any service provider can gauge DAO sentiment directly via snapshot, which will drastically reduce the burden of the Arbitrum DAO governance process put on service providers.\n\nTo ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the ability to represent itself at various events and to create new in-person experiences, we propose earmarking funds so this can be achieved in a streamlined manner. While we propose 3 core events in the section below, any DAO member can make a proposal to utilize these earmarked funds at any time. We are also happy to alter the below calendar in accordance with feedback received on the forum.\n\n## Proposed Industry Events for 2025, Q1\\&Q2\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"221\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0e4effcf28aaa53e548d8dcbda00b9edcdb8a920_2_624x221.png\" />1600×566 16.4 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0e4effcf28aaa53e548d8dcbda00b9edcdb8a920.png)\n\n\n\nThe above events were chosen based on the need to bolster Arbitrum’s presence at the industry’s top events. As mentioned above, the Questbook program has done an excellent job at making sure Arbitrum has a presence at smaller events across the globe. To date (September 10th, 2024) the events track has funded event initiatives in the following regions: Latam (8), Africa (6), India (4), APAC (4), and Europe (2).\n\nThere are also ample opportunities to fund events in the back half of 2025 that align with Arbitrum’s strategic objectives (Ex. RustConf, GamesCon, Solana Breakpoint). However, with the expectation that a more comprehensive events strategy will be rolled up into OpCo upon the hiring of a full time events coordinator, we felt it was better suited to only establish a rough strategy for the first half of 2025 while leaving the door open for other service providers and community members to bring forth their own ideas.\n\n### ETHDenver - February\n\nETHDenver is an Ethereum centric conference that has one of the largest attendee lists of any event throughout 2025. Arbitrum has historically had a presence here, but we would like to partner with OCL to bolster the DAO’s representation. We envision a very large floor space at ETHDenver (see photo below of Near’s booth at ETHDenver in 2024 for inspiration), with plenty of room for Arbitrum projects to showcase their products, delegates and other DAO contributors to talk to people who are interested in getting involved, and an area for more technical folks to ask OCL questions about the Arbitrum roadmap and tech upgrades. Last year, Arbitrum had a smaller 10x20 or 20x20 floor space at ETHDenver, but this year we want to go bigger. OCL will lead the charge on this front, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can assist as needed and funnel ideas from the community to their team.\n\n<img height=\"407\" width=\"624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 1.15.50 PM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/11b5cb68df2614f42437162176baa40b075f70d1.jpeg\" />\n\n### Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas - May\n\nThe Bitcoin conference is the most widely attended conference in all of crypto, and is ofcourse a Bitcoin-focused event. However, as seen with the rise of “BTC L2s”, Ordinals/Runes/other inscriptions, etc, there is a growing appetite from developers, users, and VCs to build out more functionality on Bitcoin. Additionally, there is work being done to enable OP\\_CAT, which could enable trust minimized bridging of BTC to other chains. As such, we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence here. There is no reason Orbit should not have a presence on Bitcoin, and the DAO recently signaled its support for Orbit deployments on alternative settlement layers via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd6138aaca39742a1a56f3219a74a4258e0786aa5494cdfbe752f23277c1b947f) vote. Bitcoin has served as the “Gateway” for bringing new people onchain in the past, and we believe targeting Bitcoin supporters is a good way to onboard new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would like to work with OCL on this event, similar to the ETHDenver event, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can procure a service provider and act as the point of contact in case OCL does not have interest in partnering with the DAO on this event.\n\n### EthCC - July\n\nEthCC, similar to ETHDenver, is one of the largest Ethereum-centric events of the year, and has historically been hosted in the EU. The event in 2025 is currently slated to take place in Cannes, France, but with the recent arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, this could potentially change. Nevertheless, this is an event that we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence at, and we again suggest supporting OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to put this event together. In the scenario that OCL/the Foundation does not want to work with the DAO on this initiative, the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will procure a 3rd party organizer to manage this event and will be in attendance to ensure things go smoothly. We are hopeful that OpCo will be stood up by this time, so there is a strong possibility that this event will fall under its purview rather than the aforementioned individuals/entities.\n\n### Other Events:\n\nWe estimate the three events outlined above to cost somewhere in the range of $250-$400k, and would thus have a budget approved that is much higher than the actual outlays. We want to avoid scenarios where we are forced to overpay for event service providers, have a limited selection of service providers, or need to rush through the DAO process in order to meet deadlines for future events. Therefore, we are requesting a budget much larger than required so that if other community members wish to push forward an event, they can do so without having to go through the full governance process.\n\nInstead, we suggest that anyone can put forth an idea for an event in the first half of 2025, but that it can pull from these pre-approved funds via a snapshot vote that must garner 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. From there, the ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe can help procure service providers to put on the event, or the proposer themselves can serve as the project manager/event coordinator. This will cut down on the lead time to put on other events and give the DAO more negotiation power when organizing events on an expedited timeline. Some other events that we had envisioned include presence at non-crypto conferences such as RustConf or CES to attract new developers and users, virtual hackathons specifically focused on Stylus or Orbit with the help of a service provider like [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/), [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/), etc. It is also important to note, that events with an expected cost under $50,000 should be routed through the Questbook program. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an events strategy for larger initiatives that require substantial funds and active project managers.\n\nIt may also be possible for protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem to partake in events that are put together with funds from this budget. For example, if a community member has an idea for the DAO to have representation at RustConf with an emphasis on showcasing some of the products built with Stylus, Entropy, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC could reach out to protocols building on Stylus to attend the event and showcase their products. Protocols could be expected to “bolster” the events budget. E.g., the DAO spends $100K while 2 Stylus projects put up $10K each to sit at the same booth. This increases the total budget by $20K at no additional cost to the DAO, and these two protocols could showcase their products in a shared booth with Arbitrum branding. This is just one example of how this could look, with the exact structures managed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe want to emphasize the fact that excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025. We felt some of the other events required a full-time project manager to ensure they go smoothly, and we do not want to take on more than we can handle. However, by requesting more budget than we require, anyone in the community can take lead on an event if there is DAO support.\n\n## Specifications\n\nIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report ([example](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530) from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.\n\nFor concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.\n\nThis is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.\n\nIn an earlier iteration of a proposal from [@danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo), there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.\n\nIt is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event’s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum’s mission forward.\n\n## Flow of Funds\n\nTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.\n\nUpdates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the [ADPC update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27) on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our [updates thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50) on the Arbitrum Forum.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 10th: “Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (4 weeks)\n2. October 10th: Snapshot Vote\n3. October 31st: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)\n4. November 18th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.\n\nWe expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.\n\n## Overall Ask\n\nThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.",

This brings the potential total term to one (1) year.\n* Funding Structure Revision: A restructuring of the funding approach to better align with the updated objectives and framework.\n* Supervisory Council Composition: The Supervisory Council will have responsibilities at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n* Supervisory Council Elections: Candidates will specify their preferred roles in the application form, but a single general election snapshot will still be conducted as initially proposed. If multiple top-ranking candidates choose the same role, the highest-ranking ones are selected for that role, while others are redirected to fill alternative roles based on their preferences.\n* Retainer Model: The payment structure for working members has been refined to better align incentives and reduce the risk of underutilisation in ARDC V2. Now, 4/5 of the cap allocated for the initial 6-month term per vertical is contingent upon actual project needs, ensuring that these payments are directly tied to usage.\n\n**The Snapshot proposal for ARDC V2 was successfully passed on 24-Oct-2024 (https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc9fc6b61c7e13a4645937937600397e496a3f4703a8f4d00e11c0f641d86ce9f) with the DAO voting for '1.73M + Council Budget'.**\n\n***Non-Constitutional***\n\nDefining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: *An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO in relation to research & development initiatives*\n\n TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to extend and build upon the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[V1], which ended up publishing 42 deliverables in the forum relating to the three verticals (Research – Security – Risk).\n* ARDC V1 returned over 1.0 million ARB to the DAO’s Treasury demonstrating how the ARDC can deliver tangible value. As ARDC V2 moves forward, this underscores the potential for further benefits that, although not always predictable, can significantly enhance the DAO’s financial position.\n* The ARDC V2 is being proposed for an initial 6-month term, with the possibility of a 6-month extension pending a future Snapshot vote.\n* Establishes a more structured and well-managed framework through the introduction of the Supervisory Council. At the micro level, the Council will consist of three elected members, with two focused on communications and one dedicated to operations.\n* The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its cohort of industry-leading research providers.\n* Utilisation of a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes.\n* The introduction of a Retainer Model to better align incentives between the Working Members and the DAO, mitigating the risk of underutilization by tying four-fifths of the applicable cap for the initial six-month term to usage as required.\n* The Snapshot proposal for ARDC V2 was successfully passed on 24-Oct-2024 and can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc9fc6b61c7e13a4645937937600397e496a3f4703a8f4d00e11c0f641d86ce9f).\n\n **ARDC v1 Overview**\n\nIn the first iteration of the ARDC, we experimented with the structure and the remuneration framework. In this regard, we adopted a DAOAdvocate role as inspired by the Arbitrum Coalition (Refer: [Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). Also, we adopted the same seats as envisaged in [Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145) the Arbitrum Coalition proposal ergo, Research, Risk and Security. In the first iteration of the ARDC, we had the pleasure of utilising the following service providers as elected by the ArbitrumDAO:\n\n* L2Beat & Ant Federation – DAO Advocate(s)\n* Blockworks Research – Research Member\n* Delphi Digital – Research Member\n* Chaos Labs – Risk Member\n* OpenZeppelin – Security Member\n\nBelow a summary of the key deliverables and achievements of the ARDC have been provided:\n\n1. \\[Blockworks Research] [STIP Analysis Case Study: GMX](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438)\n2. \\[Blockworks Research] [STIP Analysis Case Study: JOJO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438)\n3. \\[Blockworks Research] STIP Analysis: [Concerns Regarding Possible Misconduct by Synapse with Respect to the Usage of ARB Incentives Allocated Through the STIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/concerns-regarding-possible-misconduct-by-synapse-with-respect-to-the-usage-of-arb-incentives-allocated-through-the-stip/23775)\n4. \\[Blockworks Research] [STIP Bridge: Support Material for the Community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDYSLyAqeIF3yuSyMExHbRG1zHjDQZ3xE1GtG3WBhN4/edit?gid=1540434919#gid=1540434919)\n5. \\[OpenZeppelin] [Using Hedgey for Proposal Payment Vesting](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-analysis-of-using-hedgey-for-proposal-payment-vesting/23780)\n6. \\[Delphi Digital] [Gaming Catalyst Program: SWOT Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FsJf-Ou38lGJyyGLkHZ0XycqdEQRal_PhAmHM-Osbvk/edit)\n7. \\[Delphi Digital] [Gaming Catalyst Program -

Although the ARDC term has concluded, the engagement of the members will be officially regarded as ‘concluded’ upon publishing the final deliverables.*\n\nAs outlined in the [Final Outcome Report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-final-report/27050) prepared by the DAO Advocate, L2Beat, member performance should not be assessed solely by the number of deliverables completed. Each deliverable varies in complexity, making a simple tally an inadequate measure of contribution. For this reason, individual totals for each member were not compiled, as it would not provide an accurate comparison.\n\nSince the ARDC launched in April, several in-depth studies have been undertaken. A particular focus was attributed to the STIP program in individual protocols like GMX, JOJO, Vertex, Silo Finance and Pendle Finance. This included retroactive analyses on the impact of the STIP on trading volumes in perp DEX protocols, spot DEX and yield aggregator TVL, and sequencer revenue. These analyses provided valuable insights into the broader market impacts of the STIP incentives and their effectiveness in driving desired outcomes, resulting in an averageof 1,000,000 ARB being returned to the DAOs treasury.\n\nSignificant concerns regarding Synapse’s handling of ARB incentives, leading to the withdrawal of Synapse’s application from the STIP Bridge. This incident highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and transparency in the allocation and usage of incentives. Moreover, risk assessments were conducted across multiple initiatives, accompanied by several security evaluations. These included the BOLD proposal, Security Council improvements, Event Horizon contracts as well as an analysis of the Gaming Catalyst Program.\n\nThis highlights the importance of post-rollout research as a critical tool for continuous improvement, allowing the DAO to learn from past experiences and refine its strategies. By systematically analysing outcomes and identifying areas for enhancement, the DAO can build on successes, address challenges, and make increasingly informed decisions.\n\n **Summary**\n\nThis proposal builds upon the foundation established by the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective \\[V1], introducing a more efficient and structured framework. In ARDC \\[V2], proposed working members are required to specify their hourly rate in a separate application form, with the payment structure being refined to follow that of a retainer model. This will help to better align incentives given that four-fifths of the cap allocated per vertical for the initial six-month term is contingent upon actual project needs, ensuring that these payments are directly tied to usage.\n\nWe are also pleased to announce that the Arbitrum Foundation will be undertaking an ‘Observer’ role in relation to the Supervisory Council to aid in streamlining ARDC efforts, communication and overall efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, applicants must outline a scope of work for the ArbitrumDAO covering one-third of their total workload for the initial 6-month term, complete with clear deliverables and timelines. The remainder of their workload will serve as a flexible budget to address tasks on an “as-needed” basis, allowing providers to demonstrate their understanding of the ArbitrumDAO’s most pressing needs.\n\nThe final decision on the work carried out by elected working members will ultimately rest with the Supervisory Council. While the proposed scope serves as an initial framework, the Council will oversee and adjust the workload on a case-by-case basis, prioritising deliverables within each vertical and addressing any conflicts between pre-determined tasks and requests made by the ArbitrumDAO. Therefore, this proposed scope of work will not automatically apply after the election. This emphasises the Council’s crucial role in maximising the effectiveness of ARDC v2, aligning tasks with the DAO’s priorities, and ensuring smooth daily operations.\n\nThe goal is for this structure to gradually incorporate an Optimistic Governance Module (OGM), giving the community the power to veto ARDC deliverables. Unlike traditional token-based governance, which requires a majority of affirmative votes for proposals to pass, Optimistic Governance enables proposals to pass automatically unless they meet a predefined threshold of objection votes. This approach minimises bureaucratic overhead, facilitating more efficient decision-making for non-contentious proposals and fostering a more agile governance framework.\n\nIt’s important to note that ARDC v2 does not depend on the OGM for implementation; however, once Tally deploys the OGM for the DAO, a proposal will be submitted to integrate it into the ARDC structure.\n\n **Supervisory Council**\n\n**SUPERVISORY COUNCIL ROLE IN THE ARDC: DETAILED RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPORTANCE**\n\nThe DAOAdvocate’s role was intended as a single designated entity responsible for guiding the ARDC’s efforts and acting as a mediator between the DAO and the ARDC. This is fundamentally about representing the DAO’s best interests, rather than the operational management of the coalition’s activities.\n\nThese operational tasks, carried out by L2Beat included the establishing of communication channels and coordination among members, creating and maintaining a Notion page to document meeting minutes and track tasks through a kanban board, compliance and onboarding processes like KYC/KYB as well as regular updates and the maintenance of open communication channels among several others.\n\nIn the revised structure of the ARDC, we propose establishing the Supervisory Council, a body elected by the DAO to ensure alignment with its strategic and operational priorities. The Supervisory Council will be better positioned to capture the full range of perspectives and needs of the DAO community, bringing a variety of skills and viewpoints to strategic discussions.\n\nAt the same time, this Council will also be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination. This dual focus ensures that the ARDC’s activities are strategically sound while being operationally effective, closing the gap between high-level guidance and the actual execution of tasks.\n\nThis structure will consist of three (3) individuals elected by the DAO for an initial six-month term, with the option to extend for an additional six months. Each member will receive a monthly compensation of 5,000 ARB throughout their tenure. As a result, the total compensation for the council over the initial six-month period will be 90,000 ARB, and, if extended, the total cost for a full year will amount to 180,000 ARB.\n\nAt a current price of $0.52/ARB, the initial 6-month term would cost approximately $46,800. For context, the DAOAdvocate role for ARDC v1 was compensated with 50,000 ARB, which, at the current price of $1.70 would have equated to $85,000. This comparison underscores the cost-effectiveness of the ARDC v2.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will operate at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n\nBy clearly defining these roles and their corresponding responsibilities, the Council is better positioned to attract the right talent to enhance ARDC visibility and improve communication with OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between the ARDC, the DAO, the Arbitrum Foundation, and OffChain Labs.\n\n**\\[A] MACRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**Strategic Oversight & Resource Management:**\n\n1. Define overall strategic priorities for ARDC initiatives, conducting regular evaluations to ensure alignment with the DAO’s objectives. Intervene as necessary to realign projects with these priorities.\n2. Set guidelines for financial, human, and technical resource allocations, establishing frameworks that prioritise high-impact projects while allowing the micro-level team to handle daily resource distribution.\n3. Provide high-level budget oversight, ensuring resources are allocated according to strategic guidelines while empowering operations to manage day-to-day budget adherence.\n\n**Representation of DAO Interests & Coordination:**\n\n1. Serve as a central point of contact between ARDC members, the ArbitrumDAO, and external partners, ensuring the DAO’s strategic interests are reflected in ARDC decision-making.\n2. Organise periodic community consultations on major initiatives, delegating routine community engagement to the communications team. Ensure strategic topics and updates are shared with key stakeholders, including the Arbitrum community, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Conflict Resolution & Mediation:**\n\n1. Mediate conflicts that have strategic implications for the ARDC or that arise between the ARDC and the DAO, ensuring resolutions uphold the DAO’s objectives.\n2. Provide a neutral platform for resolving disputes that may impact the ARDC’s alignment with DAO goals.\n\n**\\[B] MICRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**Communication Roles: Stakeholder Communication & Engagement:**\n\n1. Translate ARDC updates and research findings into accessible language for the Arbitrum community, emphasising the significance of research and milestones.\n2. Lead routine engagement and knowledge transfer between the ARDC, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring stakeholders are well-informed on ARDC developments.\n3. Host bi-weekly community calls to keep the community informed and involved.\n\n**Communication Roles: Communication Strategy & Publication::**\n\n1. Develop and implement a communications strategy that aligns with ARDC goals and enhances visibility across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n2. Create branding and messaging guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency in ARDC’s public presence.\n3.

Maintain accurate meeting minutes, publishing them on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO.\n2. Oversee a public dashboard for ARDC members to submit task updates, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n3. Solicit quotes from service providers for deliverables approved at the macro level.\n4. Track the completion of the initial one-fifth of hours for each project, which would have been pre-paid at the start, to ensure timely monitoring of progress and facilitate smooth transitions to subsequent payment phases as required.\n5. Coordinate payments with MSS and service providers, facilitating 50% pre-delivery and 50% post-delivery payments for the remaining hours for each project.\n6. Collaborate with service providers to submit invoices to the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring payment aligns with approved deliverables.\n\n**Operations Role: Additional Operational Parameters::**\n\n1. Produce monthly reports detailing ARDC performance, including proposal updates, deliverables, and feedback from the Council.\n2. At the end of each 6-month term, prepare a comprehensive final outcome report summarising deliverables, priorities, and lessons learned, with feedback from working members on successes, challenges and key lessons learned.\n\nAdditionally, if a simple majority (2/3) of the Supervisory Council deem a member of the ARDC to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the Supervisory Council will be obliged to submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination.\n\nFollowing this, the Supervisory Council will have an ancillary obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post (for intra-ARDC elections, the same RFP-Based + Application election model will be utilised).\n\n **Risk, Security, Research**\n\n***The Risk Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe ideal Risk Member should possess strong quantitative skills to evaluate and manage risks across DeFi protocols, with sufficient expertise in modelling, simulations, and economic risk analysis. On an as-requested basis, they will assess protocol design, tokenomics, and governance mechanisms to ensure economic efficiency, incentivize usage, and safeguard systemic health. The role involves conducting thorough risk-focused research and applying modelling techniques to identify and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, the Risk Member will provide strategic guidance and data-driven insights to optimise risk management practices, supporting continuous monitoring, reporting, and informed decision-making to promote trust and sustainability in within the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n***The Security Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualising the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews.\n\n***The Research Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth.\n\nMoreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**RETAINER MODEL**\n\nIn the application form, working members must specify their hourly rate, incentivizing them to propose competitive rates to enhance their chances of selection. The maximum allowable hours for each term will be calculated by dividing the total applicable cap by the hourly rate, which will assist the Supervisory Council in budgeting and establishing a benchmark for future budget planning.\n\nAligned with the principle that “*incentives dictate outcomes*,” the Supervisory Council will oversee task approval, whether from proposed scopes of work by the working members or from incoming requests. The Council will evaluate each potential deliverable’s cost-effectiveness based on the elected members’ estimated time commitment and hourly rate. This process motivates working members to provide accurate time estimates, as overestimating could reduce their chances of being assigned the deliverable.\n\nTo provide greater financial security for working members, one-fifth of the applicable cap relating to the initial six-month term will be paid upfront upon election. For example, if a working member’s rate is $100 per hour and the DAO-approved retainer cap is $1,000, they would have a maximum of 10 hours available. In this scenario, the member would receive an upfront payment of one-fifth of the cap ($200), covering the first 2 hours of work.\n\nThe remaining portion of the cap will be contingent on actual work performed. This approach mitigates the risk of underutilisation by tying the remaining four-fifths of the applicable cap ($800) to usage as required. Once the Supervisory Council identifies a deliverable, the Operations member will issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the relevant working member, outlining the anticipated hours needed. Following delegate feedback, the amount to be paid upfront was updated from one-third to one-fifth of the applicable cap for the initial six-month term.\n\nThis model ensures that:\n\n* Work allocation is optimised, avoiding the pitfall of completing suboptimal tasks solely to justify a prepaid expense, a challenge faced in ARDC V1 where DAO leverage was reduced.\n* Working members remain incentivised to perform efficiently, as the remainder of their payment is linked directly to hours allocated by the Supervisory Council.\n\nFollowing the completion of the initial one-fifth allocation, payment for subsequent work will be structured as follows: members will receive 50% of the quoted hours’ payment before commencing each deliverable, with the remaining amount paid upon satisfactory completion. This phased payment structure promotes accountability and reinforces efficient, quality work.\n\n**ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nThe ARDC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the passing of the Snapshot proposal. A high-level overview of this process can be found in the diagram below.\n\n<img height=\"451\" width=\"602\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfjkAH_6j_OXj_gQnGLGzuRTmLQUBZxxMZTqU29g1hQFFxClSjMEpGper7r_CmT1xwI4iR19yS_El0nrNm4N7BqswdkWYMC7Qu36Q21Z90ypFB2BXJmACKJQNIT5ah1OliakKWJ26OSP3e__6YO95vyv1E?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nAll ARDC members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ARDC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions].\n\nThere will be four separate elections held:\n\n1. Risk-Oriented Member;\n2. Security-Oriented Member;\n3. Research-Oriented Member; and\n4. Supervisory Council.\n\nTo minimise voter fatigue, the Supervisory Council elections will be conducted through a single, general election snapshot. Candidates will be required to specify their desired role in their application. For instance, if the top three elected candidates all apply for the Communication role, only the top two will be selected for that role. The third position will then be filled by the highest-ranking candidate who applied for the Operations role, ensuring a balanced allocation of roles within the Council.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election process that starts at time T \\[‘T’ means the date that the Snapshot vote passes +3 days]:\n\n**GOVERNING RULES**\n\nWhile a joint application for each seat is permissible, an applicant may not apply as part of a joint application with other applicants & then proceed to apply as a Supervisory Council member or for another seat.\n\nThe fees (hourly rate/s) in the respective elected member’s forum post application will apply once elected via Snapshot as per the Election Process. \n\n**ELECTION STRUCTURE**\n\n*1. Application Submission (T+14 business days):*\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template;\n\n*2. Proposal Review Period (7 business day period following end of Application Submission Period):*\n\nThis period will be utilised for delegates to be able to review each proposal as submitted by applicants.\n\n*3. Amendment Period (3 business day period following the end of the Proposal Review period whereby applicants may amend their application):*\n\nApplicants may amend their applications in light of community feedback during this time period.\n\n*4. Member election (7  day period following end of Amendment Period):*\n\nA Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up per vertical including the list of all eligible candidates:\n\n1. Snapshot for Risk-Oriented Member election;\n2. Snapshot for Security-Oriented Member election;\n3. Snapshot for Research-Oriented Member election; and\n4. Snapshot for Supervisory Council.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ARDC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\nFurthermore, please find the election templates for the Supervisory Council and respective seats, designed to guide prospective applicants through the application process, as well as details regarding timelines on the published Notion site [here](https://fuzzy-cookie-e9c.notion.site/Arbitrum-Research-Development-Collective-10c34346ff0480dd9fd0efa450941d03). Interested applicants are encouraged to join the ARDC V2 Election chat on Telegram [here](https://t.me/+g4olHPPQiZtkYThk).\n\n**CHECKS & BALANCES**\n\nThe ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:\n\nAppointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.\n\n* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:\n\n*“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \\[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \\[https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances]*\n\n* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:\n\n*““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at* [*The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 4*](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) *(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*\n\n1. [\\*Snapshot 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) (or any successor thereto); or\\*\n2. *another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.*\"\n\n**CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISION:**\n\nARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, with utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorised profits from their position & disclosing conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Council who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**MANDATE & PURPOSE OF THE ARDC:**\n\nThe ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also the role of the Supervisory Council, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING:**\n\nComprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. The Supervisory Council will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the Supervisory Council. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**DUTY OF IMPARTIALITY:**\n\nARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**OBLIGATION OF RECUSAL:**\n\nARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**PROHIBITION OF SELF-DEALING:**\n\nParticipants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organisations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship.\n\n**ETHICAL TRADING:**\n\nMembers are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n **TERM**\n\nThe ARDC’s mandate will be structured in two phases:\n\n* Phase 1: Upon the passing of this proposal, the first tranche of funding for 182 days (6 months) will be unlocked. The ARDC’s mandate will commence 30 days (not business days) after the on-chain proposal is approved and executed. This provides sufficient time for the elected members and personnel to complete KYC/KYB with the Arbitrum Foundation and finalise the grant agreement.\n* Phase 2 - Extending Decision: At the end of the initial 6-month term, a Snapshot vote will be held, offering the ArbitrumDAO the following options:\n  * Extend the ARDC with the same working members.\n  * Extend the ARDC with a re-election of the working members.\n  * Do not extend the ARDC\n\nIf the DAO chooses not to extend the ARDC after the initial term, MSS will return the remaining USDC + ARB to the Treasury. There will be no subsequent OTC to buy back ARB with the USDC.\n\nThe ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the Supervisory Council following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the necessary communication channels.\n\n**FUNDING (ARDC V1)**\n\nIn the ARDC v1, the ARDC was funded with 1.76M ARB, which at a price of $1.7/ARB amounted to approximately $3.01M USD, inclusive of a bugger of around 30%. For the elected members at the time of the proposal, this would have amounted to:\n\n* Research – $1.13M USD \\[Quoted fees by Blockworks Research & Delphi Digital - $960,000]\n* Security – $1.13M USD \\[Quoted fees by OpenZeppelin - $$750,000]\n* Risk – $0.57M \\[Quoted fees by Chaos Labs - $320,000]\n* DAO Advocate – $85,000\n\nWhile the Final Outcome Report notes that the ‘ROI’ of ARDC V1 can’t be objectively quantified, the return of over 1.0 million ARB to the DAO’s Treasury demonstrates how ARDC can deliver tangible value. As ARDC V2 moves forward, this achievement underscores the potential for further benefits that, although not always predictable, can significantly enhance the DAO’s financial position and overall impact.\n\nDue to the decrease in ARB’s price, the total cost of ARDC V1 amounted to approximately $1.0M USD, which we’ve designated as the baseline for Option B below. The amounts for Option A and Option C are estimated to be around 20% higher and lower, respectively.\n\nIn ARDC v1 funds were held in a 3/5 multi sig, however, for the ARDC v2, the multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the [Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) established by Entropy Advisors. This adjustment will save the ARDC V2 30,000 ARB by reducing the need for five multi-signature signers.\n\n**FUNDING (ARDC V2)**\n\n**ARB Token Calculation**\n\nTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on 27-Oct-2024 on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility.\n\nA 20% buffer has been added to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution, so in the case of ARB depreciation, the ARDC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. The Multi-Sig wallet established by the MSS can be found at the following address: arb1:0x8deBa81C874C68C27a09706CdEa50d4F727E0711\n\nThe total budget requested from the on-chain vote is ARB 3,982,602, calculated based on the time-weighted ARB price of $0.5574/ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB amount [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19RlU-6FeM8dTPu4ct2GIeuvooG9SlMbt9v0dGSwSwV0/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Upon receiving the ARB, we will convert 1.73M USDC worth of ARB. Payment distributions solely for the Supervisory Council will be initiated through Llama Pay with payments for elected Risk, Security & Research members effected by the MSS.\n\n35,000 ARB to [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) as retroactive payment for the drafting, review and refinement of this proposal, as well as the managing of the election process itself and ensuring execution of all steps pre-commencement of the term. The 35,000 ARB will be delegated to the Immutablelawyer Tally profile for a minimum period of 90 days following receipt of funds. This increase is reflective of additional reviews, amendments, and hours allocated for refinement by our team.\n\nIn response to feedback received, allocations associated with risk have been increased by 20%. Additionally, the figures provided below are based on a full 1-year term. Should a decision be made not to extend ARDC v2, the funded amount would be capped at a maximum of half the amounts shown.\n\n**FUND CONVERSION (AERA)**\n\n### **Arb Conversion Strategy**\n\nThe ARDC will utilise a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes, reducing counterparty price risk on OTC desks. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilises off-chain logic to monitor on chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ARDC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop.\n\n<img height=\"224\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeCD-x_-Um9_MqT7ZQOi9Gff6tLxit0QGgzVpA6oTXH-ROsqX-bJcKtd5R8QeOujvz2syx917p0_e4EOhcUVRi_bdVEVZvm-zmAiBoDwr2efh2vpKCw5hfdpGIdwCry8Xf3Q-vbVParjr5llEnicJzGxJ_r?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\n**Protocol-Owned Execution**\n\nThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor on chain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading.\n\nFor ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver).\n\nPassive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and [more](https://www.odos.xyz/about)). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.\n\n<img height=\"136\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdN_Zi6DkeqG4WfrxC4uhc7puzN10IdS0On3gmB32Pf0CNPHVWxXpxAJwvSUUPm3_RGjv_iqzcRyeYLJPCIteqiQSS6Cg8F6T00gqTxMiDkxYV94m7q0gNPSDxcU7rUdGIZzKL-M-FFgfzgXfys4vHqPw0?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximise liquidity sourcing. Price impact modelling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.\n\nIntraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.\n\n<img height=\"444\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdE6s4YD8H8jBWuvhB2gii7vI8c6W4rEQZN-ymru4xfl9JV8SiUC5fvk33D5oB1W2YGHO389eEGOplDcRYc2Dqsq1-GkBn0ntTejQ7w-qJyr3wGDVCTsmLKFDikipKd7SSMXgrZXm0aZG6DuA3qB4QSUqc?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nThe example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.\n\n<img height=\"419\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXexNJBI-v6DX9a_yoNTX9hPc_1WTNAeoZsO9UWCu_ZsqiCpmDz0fq3kva4Xn6v7FJ26JEtDdaNxKW_CARa6q0I5EuVI-dzlSxhxpN3KFK84mLBtqcBUSGCY5On9for2sXbd9WZmjwNMVEIpUj51ErpGHT5E?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nThe example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.\n\nARDC Vault Parameters\n\n* Chain: Arbitrum\n* Vault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x8deBa81C874C68C27a09706CdEa50d4F727E0711)\n* Guardian: Gauntlet\n* Tokens: ARB, USDC\n* Protocols: Odos, Bebop\n* Strategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimising market impact\n* Fee: 0%\n\n### **About Aera**\n\nAera is an on-chain solution to optimise DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.\n\nTo address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.\n\nYou can read more about Aera [here](https://docs.aera.finance/).",

Proposed Support Program\n\n* Program Structure (Two Phases)\n* RnDAO Program’s Value\n\n1. Implementation Plan - Budget\n2. Funds Management\n3. Reporting\n4. Investment Agreement and Arbitrum benefits\n5. Long-Term Vision\n6. Conclusion\n7. FAQs\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nA few months ago, Arbitrum funded the [Arbitrum CollabTech Hackathon](https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/arbitrum-collabtech-hackathon-impact-report) through Questbook. This month-long event has just come to an end, having gathered great talent and energy.\n\nWe’ve got\n\n* 164 applications and [144 participants](https://lu.ma/pkbzi9ab)\n* 20 projects submitted\n* [15 finalist projects](https://x.com/RnDAO__/status/1854246689554776121) that are solving real problems with tech for governance, identity, reputation, and more. All are built on Arbitrum.\n* [3 winners having built a narrowly focused PoC]()\n* Contribo: matching talent to tasks is a foundational need in any collaboration. Contribo is tackling the right parts of this well, focusing on smooth UX and simplicity yet strong onchain components.\n* Signals: A much-needed tool for DAOs to easily define priorities and transform chat-group noise into meaningful proposals. It also provides additional utility for native tokens.\n* Separated Powers: A more flexible approach to role definition, well architected. Could advance automation in onchain organisations significantly and provide a system for reducing the overhead of checks and balances.\n\nWe’ve created a funnel for builders on Arbitrum and we want to sustain this momentum. However, without support, the teams will soon seek opportunities elsewhere. Questbook new protocols track is out of funding but, even if it had funding, the projects need not only capital but also network access and expertise.\n\nRnDAO proposes to co-fund (roughly 50-50) a program in partnership with Arbitrum to invest in and support these teams.\n\nThis program is designed to take projects from a hackathon PoC to engage in systematic customer validation, iterate and develop an MVP, and get their first 100 users. As such, we’re leveraging the raw talent and expecting the projects to evolve significantly as they engage and validate with customers, achieving traction at the end of the program.\n\n# 2. The Solution: Turn Hackathon Wins into Long-Term Success\"\n\nEarly-stage projects often stall or fail within a few months because they lack a deep understanding of their target audience and its needs. Systematic customer validation can significantly increase the likelihood of projects thriving beyond this initial stage.\n\nThis initiative, co-funded by RnDAO and Arbitrum, aims to build an ecosystem of unique Arbitrum-based projects that will continue to grow and attract new projects.\n\nWe’ve designed a 6-month, two-phase program to capture the best of the hackathon talent and energy.\n\n* Phase 1 focuses on validating ideas (customer development, lean startup, and design thinking methods) and understanding the competitive landscape.\n* Phase 2 supports projects to move from PoC to the development of a market-viable MVP and securing the first 100 users.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n* We will select the 4 most promising hackathon teams to join the program (through due diligence by the RnDAO investment committee and signing of an investment contract).\n* Each project will receive an initial stipend ($12k over 3 months) in Phase 1.\n* Upon successful completion of user research, validation of interest, and presentation of a viable business case (solid pitch deck), the top 2 projects can move to Phase 2.\n* Phase 2 projects are awarded an additional $38k and receive hands-on support (sales strategy, biz dev, marketing amplification, intros to funders, team formation, setting up ops processes and legal, setting up agile product development processes, etc.).\n\nGoals:\n\n* short-term (6 months): projects validate their concepts with customers (first 100 users) and generate traction to fundraise from investors or otherwise receive follow-on funding or generate revenue.\n* long-term: create a group of unique ventures that collaborate and integrate ([business cluster](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/business-clusters-as-a-strategy-for-arbitrum/21098)), drawing in new projects like a magnet with less direct involvement from our team.\n\n# 3. Proposed Support Program\n\nProgram Structure (Two Phases)\n\nBy breaking funding and mentorship into two distinct phases, we derisk capital allocation. Only projects that successfully validate customer demand and can showcase a market gap in the first phase will advance to the second phase, ensuring that resources are focused on ventures with proven potential.\n\n[<img height=\"196\" width=\"690\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f977ad8d550f36967b0105502bdb172c9621c1a8_2_690x196.jpeg\" />image1920×548 28.2 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f977ad8d550f36967b0105502bdb172c9621c1a8.jpeg \"image\")\n\n**Phase 1: Entrepreneurs in Residence (EiR) - Customer Validation (3 Months)**\n\n* Funding: Each project receives $2,000 per month per cofounder (max 2 cofounders receiving funding per project), totalling $12,000 per project for Phase 1.\n* Goal: Support validation with real users to confirm demand and solidify the project’s foundation.\n* Process: Most hackathon projects lack any customer validation and have a shallow understanding of the problem. As such, they fail to gain traction and die. In Phase 1 we focus on addressing these issues head-on by guiding projects through a structured customer validation process, with\n* weekly strategy and customer development mentoring sessions\n* shadowing user research calls and providing feedback\n* multiple hours of hands-on support per week (up to 8 hours per week directly with each project and extra cohort work) to refine their outreach campaigns (tactical support on copy, messaging, refining target user groups, introductions, implementing automation tools, etc.) and support on making the competitive landscape.\n\n**Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2:**\n\n* Assessment by RnDAO investment committee (we’ll invest significant labour in the next phase and so will only approve teams we deem viable).\n* Assessment based on market viability (clearly understood customer problem, market gap, proposed solution based on customer insights, viable team).\n\n**Phase 2: Development and Scaling (3 Months)**\n\n* Funding: Projects that successfully complete Phase 1 will receive an additional grant of $38,000 each, amounting to a total of $50,000 per venture across both phases (enough to build and market test a basic MVP plus 3 months runway for market testing and securing the next bit of funding).\n* Goal: This phase supports full product development, go-to-market strategy, and readiness for sustainable operation, whether through fundraising, revenue, or further grants.\n* Process: After initial customer validation, the key challenge for founders is being spread too thin, while needing to set up an effective, agile product development process to quickly validate hypotheses and accelerate product-market-fit, ensure financial sustainability (pitch development and fundraising), set up a fully functioning team (talent recruitment), and operate the organisation (admin and ops). We’ll help teams with all of these challenges, operating as a fractional c-suite (down in the trenches with them, up to 10 hours per week with each project and extra cohort work) and fast-track their brand recognition and network with the support of our marketing team.\n\nRnDAO Program’s Value and advantages over regular incubation programs\n\n1. Swarm Collaboration: participants join an alliance of similar projects, encouraging integrations (good for project retention in Arbitrum), sharing best practices, co-marketing, cross-selling, and more. RnDAO facilitates this through a system of guilds, collaborative databases, cross-ownerhsip, and facilitating specific collaborations.\n2. Not just advisory, hands-on operators: we get our hands dirty working directly in the projects, fast-tracking their development with world-class expertise, including [Drea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagallagher/) (led research for Google Suite, Asana, Aragon, etc. 50% time-commitment to the program), [Gokhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polat/details/experience/) (venture-building expert and 8x entrepreneur. Full-time commitment to the program), and [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conductal/) (organisation designer, ex-Head of Gov Aragon, 4x founder, etc. full-time commitment to the program.). Additionally, we provide access to industry-leading mentors (e.g. mentors for the Hackathon included Kevin Owoki, Nader Dabit, Dennison Bertram, Reka Medvcz, David Phelps, etc.).\n3. Network access:\n\n* Support in establishing customer relationships by leveraging the RnDAO vertically-specialized network and peers’ networks.\n* Assistance in securing additional funding and achieving self-sustainability.\n* Talent network and talent attraction support via RnDAO community and comms channels.\n\n1. Enhanced Visibility:\n\n* Increased attention from investors and customers through the RnDAO brand umbrella and marketing initiatives.\n\nCombined, these strategies enable us to provide high-quality and hands-on support, customer access, market insights, and talent access, resulting in faster time to market and reduced failure rate for projects.\n\nMore on Swarm methodology and data-backed comparison with other types of programs:[ https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic](https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic)\n\nOverview of support offered: ​​\n\n[https://docsend.com/view/jys5wqqg9vi8qknm](https://docsend.com/view/jys5wqqg9vi8qknm)\n\nProgram Outcome:\n\nIn six months, we aim for at least 2 of the projects to:\n\n1. Get their first 100 users.\n2. generate revenue (early validation), and/or\n3. secure additional grants or successfully fundraise to continue growing.\n\n# 4. Implementation Plan - Budget\n\nThe budget is divided in 4 categories:\n\n* Capital Investment into the projects: direct capital allocation to the teams.\n* Venture Support: hands-on support and mentorship given to the projects.\n* Program Ops: creation of monthly program reports to the DAO & delegates stakeholder management, program branding and promotion of Arbitrum as a great home for builders (including coordination with Arbitrum Foundation marketing team), program management and overhead (team mamangement and contracting)\n* Grants: an incentive for user interview participants in Phase 1.\n\n### Total Program Cost:\n\n[<img height=\"219\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/037a09ecabf00ed4b4cc885c67e1060075bb33fa_2_690x219.png\" />791×252 59.3 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/037a09ecabf00ed4b4cc885c67e1060075bb33fa.png)\n\n* Difference with previous budget:\n* CollabBerry grant has been eliminated as per the Snapshot vote.\n* Based on feedback, we also added an extra cost ($2,000) for post program reporting (3 months after completion).\n* The cost attribution has been reviewed for increased granularity between Ops and Ventures Support.\n\n[](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/hackathon-continuation-program/27492/85 \"go to the quoted post\")<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/danielo/48/5539_2.png\" /> danielo:\n\n> As a nounance (we’ll clarify this before going onchain), the Comms costs are added within Ops but technically we can break these down with more sophisticated accounting into:\\* program reporting\\* amplifying projects through RnDAO channels and coordinating with Arbitrum Foundaton and others to amplify\\* coaching projects on comms/growthSo perhaps anoher 10-15k can be attributed to Venture Support.\n\n* Given our internal model of a small team that has to complete multiple tasks, the cost attribution can be broken down in multiple ways. Previously we opted for a simple rule of thumb to reduce confusion amongst delegates (unsuccesfully): Contributor A gets attributed 100% to Ops, Contributor B 100% to Venture Support. Now the system is more akin to Contributor A split between Ops and Venture Support as per their responsibilities, and same for Contributor B, etc. We can’t share this data publicly without revealing sensitive details of our operation including the total earnings of each contributor. If delegates consider an audit essential, we can only offer access after singing an NDA. We encourage the DAO to develop standard guidelines as the level of granularity demanded across suppliers vary greatly and a privacy-preserving mechanism would be ideal.\n* How RnDAO cost are calculated: The RnDAO budget contribution is based on the provision of services valued at the cost of the staff contracted for this pilot (rates based on full-time equivalent, not on freelancer/consultant rates). The value is thus not calculated on the rate we could charge for these services but merely on our own internal cost. The fee structure means that RnDAO runs the program at a deficit (we invest significantly into the startups, generating a financial loss). The model is designed so RnDAO can recoup this loss over the long term IF the projects incubated become significantly valuable.\n\n# 5. Funds Management & Payment Schedule\n\nThe funds provided by ArbitrumDAO will be transferred to the Arbitrum MSS.\n\nThe funds are then transferred from the MSS wallet in two phases and to two separate RnDAO controlled multisigs for easy auditing\n\n* RnDAO multisig for Capital deployment into projects\n* RnDAO multisig for Program (combined ops, venture support, and interviewees grant).\n\n[<img height=\"175\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1bb09788ba9d1e881553abdaea64f083faf3a8f0.png\" />795×202 39.4 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1bb09788ba9d1e881553abdaea64f083faf3a8f0.png)\n\n# 6. Reporting\n\nMonthly reports for the duration of the program including\n\n* overall program progress (timeline, budget usage, execution challenges if any)\n* venture selected and rationale (at the start of phase 1 and phase 2)\n* venture status updates (stage of development, traction and news)\n* learnings (retrospective on last month and actions)\n\nReport 3 months after project completion including\n\n* venture status updates (stage of development, traction and news)\n\n# 7. Investment Agreement and Arbitrum benefits\n\n* We’ll provide the Arbitrum Foundation with a proposed template and agree on the exact format, clauses, and wording to be used.\n* The baseline template we envision is a contract that covers 3 scenarios: equity fundraising (SAFE) + protocolisation and token launch (Token Warrant) + a side letter covering the scenario of the projects not fundraising nor issuing a token. TBC with the foundation.\n* The contract shall stipulate the division of proceeds between RnDAO and the Foundation, which we envision to be 50-50 (pending confirmation from the foundation).\n* The contract shall enable the Foundation to transfer the contract to an Arbiturm-affiliated entity of their choosing (e.g. CapCo).\n* If no agreement with the foundation is reached on the contract, the program will be discontinued and the funds returned minus any spent legal fees (max $2,500).\n\n# 8. Long-Term Vision\n\n* we can run more hackathons and incubation programs, further growing the business cluster\n* Successful execution will create a self-sustaining business cluster - a magnet that attracts more projects without our active contribution.\n\n# 9. Conclusion\n\nWith the Arbitrum CollabTech Hackathon, we’ve successfully launched 15 projects in Arbitrum. Now we have the opportunity to keep fueling this momentum and pioneer investments in Arbitrum DAO.\n\nWe’re open to questions and ready to bring this to a vote to gather your feedback. Based on the feedback received we’ll refine the proposal before moving to an onchain vote.\n\n# 10.

    "description": "# Treasury Management V1.2\n## Abstract\n\nOn September 12th, Entropy hosted a preliminary treasury working group call (recordings available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/6)) in an effort to align all of the different parties within the DAO on the optimal path forward when it comes to managing the different sections of the DAO’s balance sheet. I.e., chain profits (ETH) and tokens that have been authorized for spend but have not entered circulation yet (ARB). The primary points of contention were around ARB diversification, the need for a DAO budget before the conversation on treasury management continues forward, whether the DAO needs active treasury managers at all, infrastructure selection, and details around a treasury committee’s implementation, e.g., how many individuals/entities, are they DAO-elected or appointed, when should we target to have this committee stood up, etc. From our perspective, we did gain consensus that the DAO’s profits (ETH) in the treasury should be turned productive and that a treasury management committee of some sort should be established. However, even on these two points that most people seem to be in favor of, specific details need to be ironed out for actionable strategies to be implemented.\n\nWe believe that we have come up with a fair compromise between all of the various perspectives on these identified issues, all of which stem from the information gathered during the working group calls and conversations with delegates. The compromise suggested herein will, in our opinion, enable the DAO to move forward and initiate the required operational standards for optimizing the use of idle tokens in the treasury. Based on the feedback received on the call on September 25th (link to recording [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7)) where we presented the overarching ideas herein, we feel confident that this proposal aligns well with the treasury managers, infrastructure providers, and overall DAO sentiment towards treasury management. We are eager to gather more feedback from the community and continue iterating so this initiative can move forward.\n\n## Key Issues Treasury Management can Solve Today\n\n1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse’s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield—consistent with the DAO’s growth-first mindset.\n\n## The Proposed Solution\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* Establish two token management tracks (Treasury and Growth) with their own 3-seat committees. Treasury Management will focus on passive yield via ARB-only onchain strategies on Arbitrum One and create a cash-like reserve alongside a management strategy to cover service provider shortfalls. Growth Management will focus on strategic partnerships by exclusively reinvesting the DAO’s ETH holdings into “ETH-backed strategies”. ETH-backed strategies are defined as opportunities that earn yield on ETH or ETH-pegged assets, with high guarantees of returning the underlying deployed to the DAO treasury at a certain point in the future.\n  * Treasury Management ™: 10M ARB for ARB-only onchain strategies + 15M ARB converted to stables or other cash-like holdings to serve as a pilot for the DAO’s “checking account”.\n  * Growth Management (GM): 7,500 ETH allotted (about 75% of the DAOs ETH after BoLD bootstrapping), but all spend must be DAO-approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince inception, the DAO has spent 19.3M ARB on core DAO initiatives (long-term committees/groups that get funding directly from the DAO via proposal), grants programs, and direct DAO-to-service provider grants according to the August [Token Flow](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/108327950/8/#zoom=true) report from @r3gen. So outside of protocol/user incentives and the large GCP initiative, the DAO’s spend has been relatively modest throughout the first 18 months of its life, spending about 1.07M ARB per month. The average price of ARB since the token launched sits at $1.16, which puts the DAO’s rough monthly spend on these types of initiatives at $1.24M USD.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would have a budget outlined before setting aside some ARB to be converted to stablecoins or other cash-like assets to cover general operating expenses and make up for any service provider contract shortcomings. However, we need the proper people and procedures in place in order for a budget to be executed to the expected standard. We believe that the OpCo will not only be better equipped to tackle this issue, but will also have better incentive alignment with the DAO than any other entity/individual tasked with creating a DAO budget, and more data surrounding DAO-revenue to analyze.\n\nIn many cases it is unprofessional for the DAO to put the burden of ARB volatility on its service providers. If we aren’t careful, we will negatively impact the pool of SPs that desire working with Arbitrum DAO. Given the aforementioned historical spend and the absence of a formal budget, we are suggesting the TM track be given 25M ARB with the intent to swap 15M ARB for stablecoins over the course of 3 months. This stablecoin reserve may be deployed in low-risk, yield-bearing strategies or other cash-like assets and will be used to cover DAO dollar-denominated expenses and service provider contract shortfalls. This cash-like balance should not be used to give out grants, but rather to pay out service providers that demand dollars. The remaining 10M ARB is to be used on ARB-only onchain strategies that are approved by the TM Committee (TMC). The TM track will solve problems 1&2 mentioned above by putting the infrastructure and service providers in place to conduct onchain strategies on both ARB and stablecoins while ensuring service providers enjoy a professional/stress-free experience working with Arbitrum. The TMC’s mandate also indirectly supports ecosystem growth by focusing primarily on ARB-only strategies by leveraging Arbitrum protocols.\n\nThe need to reinvest sequencer revenue is best depicted by the following chart, which shows the DAO has foregone ~400 ETH by not staking its idle holdings.\n\n\n[<img height=\"402\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Arbitrum Revenue\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3f25fde491adc04de29d44b4d527e5f7ec5ea064_2_690x402.png\" />Arbitrum Revenue2400×1400 270 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3f25fde491adc04de29d44b4d527e5f7ec5ea064.png \"Arbitrum Revenue\")\n\nHowever, given that the primary goal of the Arbitrum DAO is spreading its technology stack and promoting growth across its ecosystem, we believe that we can do better than just staking the ETH or otherwise reinvesting DAO profits into liquid market opportunities. Furthermore, Entropy Advisors has been approached by numerous protocols interested in strengthening their alliance with the Arbitrum DAO. These protocols include market leaders within well-established DeFi and infrastructure sub sectors as well as projects in emerging verticals that have generated significant attention within the industry. Some of these projects are pre-TGE, generate significant revenue, could solve liquidity fragmentation/interoperability across Orbit chains, or strengthen ARB narratives. These types of deals require a counterparty to negotiate with and discretion until a deal is formally reached. This will be one of the primary deliverables of the Growth Management Committee (GMC), but all deals will need to be approved by the DAO via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply prior to any engagement’s execution. Again, only strategies that rely on ETH and ETH-pegged asset strategies will be pursued. It is important to note that some specific details may need to remain confidential even once the DAO begins voting via Snapshot. The GMC will play a similar role as the STEP committee so that this can be achieved. A stark contrast between the TMC and GMC is that the former will make a one-time recommendation to the DAO on how to allocate the full 25M ARB across various RFP applicants, whereas the latter will make one-off recommendations that are ad hoc in nature.\n\n\n\n## TMC and GMC: Members, Deliverables, and Pay\n\nWhile we could staff these positions via DAO election, we believe that it would be more efficient to appoint these individuals/entities given the specific qualifications required of the members. These council members will serve a term of around 6 months, with payments for both TMC and GMC members tied to specific milestones.\n\nWhen it comes to the TMC, each member will be eligible to claim 20K USDC for each of the following milestones achieved: 1) RFP process finalized and the TMC’s final recommendation of which managers to move forward with and the respective amounts allocated approved via Snapshot; 2) The first quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous oversight of strategies having been performed 3) The second quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous oversight of strategies having been performed.\n\nIn terms of the GMC, the three milestones, each of which will unlock a 20K USDC payment per member (excluding Entropy), are as follows: 1) RFP process finalized and the GMC’s first recommendation to which project(s) to allocate capital to approved through Snapshot; 2) given the DAO approves an allocation to a project, the first quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous risk monitoring having been performed; 3) given the DAO approves an allocation to a project, the second quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous risk monitoring having been performed.\n\nIn other words, both councils’ members (excluding Entropy) will be eligible for a total of 60K USDC per member, given they reach all of their respective milestones. As always, the DAO can remove these members from the council, replace committee members with other candidate(s), or disband this program altogether at any point in time through a Snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. Entropy Advisors is happy to assist in any type of open election process if that is deemed necessary in the future.\n\nSuggested TMC Members:\n\n* **Austin Campbell**:\n  * With a multi-decade background in trading, financial risk management, and structuring, [Austin Campbell](https://x.com/CampbellJAustin) is regarded as a leading expert in the field of tokenized assets, stablecoins, and crypto risk management. Austin has run trading desks at JP Morgan and Citigroup, been the head of portfolio management and chief risk officer at Paxos, and is currently the CEO of WSPN USA, a stablecoin issuer. Austin also teaches blockchain courses at NYU Stern school of business, speaks frequently on podcasts, to the media, and at regulatory events, and testified in front of Congress on stablecoins in 2023.\n  * Austin believes that treasury management in the crypto space should focus on principal protection, liquidity to ensure smooth operations, and risk-adjusted return, in that order. Austin has helped with previous efforts in this space when at Paxos, including the inclusion of USDP into the PSM for MakerDAO, as well as partnering with protocols to ensure strong economic design and stability when integrating stablecoins and real assets. A robust RFP process, a rigorous set of standards for anyone managing treasury assets, and programs for monitoring performance, activities, and conflicts are things that Austin believes are mandatory for effective treasury programs.\n\nAustin will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Three Sigma**:\n  * As seasoned experts in the DeFi ecosystem, [Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz/) is uniquely positioned to add significant value to Arbitrum’s Treasury Management Council (TMC). With vast experience in risk assessment and advisory services, Three Sigma is equipped to collaboratively design and execute a transparent Request for Proposal (RFP) process for treasury managers. These RFPs will strategically identify managers aligned with the DAO’s objectives—such as converting ARB to stablecoins, optimizing fund deployment, and managing whitelisted ARB strategies.\n  * Three Sigma’s commitment extends beyond process design, as they will serve as vigilant overseers of treasury management strategies, proactively flagging any questionable activities to the DAO. Drawing from extensive experience in helping teams design protocols with risk in mind, they uphold the principle: “Don’t trust, verify.” Three Sigma will develop a robust methodology focused on risk-adjusted returns, evaluate service provider performance, and deliver quarterly reports to the DAO forum. These reports will offer transparent insights into performance metrics, stablecoin balances, and strategic recommendations for asset liquidation or replenishment. Leveraging their deep understanding of DeFi markets, risk management, and governance, Three Sigma aims to drive optimal outcomes for the Arbitrum DAO, safeguarding the community’s assets with unwavering accountability.\n\nThree Sigma will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Make Markets**:\n  * A bespoke consulting agency focused on liquidity strategy design and optimization for asset issuers, Make Markets brings deep crypto-native technical expertise to Arbitrum’s Treasury Management Council through its principals [fiddyresearch](https://x.com/fiddyresearch), a core contributor to Curve DAO, and benny, a seasoned DeFi builder, analytics specialist and contributor to Curve DAO. We combine practical DeFi protocol engineering experience with extensive knowledge of smart contract security, on-chain data analysis and decentralized market mechanics. Their technical background enables them to assess smart contract risk and economic security considerations when reviewing strategy proposals for managers. They will also leverage our analytics capabilities and familiarity with on-chain data to provide data-driven reporting to the DAO.\n  * Make Markets believes that the TMC’s success depends on establishing robust, standardized processes for evaluating and monitoring treasury managers. Their goal is to implement systematic approaches that ensure fair selection, efficient oversight, and clear performance assessment across all treasury activities. They aim to establish consistent and transparent processes that will serve the DAO over the long term and ensure accountability to the community.\n\nMake Markets will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n**TMC Deliverables and Expected Timeline**:\n\n* Design and host an RFP process seeking treasury managers with predefined overarching strategies. E.g., the process for converting ARB to stables, how the stables can be deployed when sitting idle, the process for a DAO contributor to request stablecoins from this program within their proposal, whitelisted stablecoin/ARB strategies or protocols, etc. **Timeline: 4 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Make a recommendation to the DAO in regards to which treasury managers should be allocated funds alongside how much goes to each service provider. This will need to be passed through Snapshot with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. The TMC is expected to post the rationale behind their recommendation on the DAO forum. If a recommendation to the DAO results in a failed vote, the TMC will reconvene and examine the reasons posted by delegates to come up with a revised allocation that addresses the community’s concerns. **Timeline: 6 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Serve as a check/balance on strategies deployed by treasury managers, and flagging any questionable strategies being deployed to the DAO. This work will be ongoing work once the funds have been deployed until the end of the committee’s engagement. If the OpCo is not at a point where it can absorb/oversee these responsibilities, Entropy will put up a continuation proposal to make sure that risk management capabilities are maintained. **Timeline: Continuously after fund deployment**\n* Developing a methodology for evaluating service provider performance, with risk-adjusted returns as the focal point. **Timeline: Finalized before fund deployment; facilitated continuously after fund deployment**\n* Prepare quarterly reports (2 over the course of their term) for the DAO forum that provides visibility into service provider performance.\n  * These reports should also include updates on the stablecoin balance, and provide recommendations to the DAO in relation to liquidating more of the allocated ARB for stablecoins, or requesting additional ARB to top up the stablecoin reserve. Timeline: Every 3 months after fund deployment\n\n**Suggested GMC Members**:\n\n* [Entropy Advisors](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors)\n  * Entropy Advisors will be waiving payment.\n* [Callen](https://x.com/cvant_) from Wintermute\n  * Callen will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n* [Llama Risk](https://www.llamarisk.com/)\n  * Llama Risk will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\nThe primary qualifications for GMC members are the ability to negotiate deals and possess large networks within the wider crypto industry. They may also be required to sign and adhere to NDAs. Entropy felt it was important to add a risk-focused member to the GMC so that economic, general smart contract, and other design risks can be better accounted for when evaluating deals. The GMC will receive support from Arbitrum partnership teams (Foundation and OCL), thus ensuring all opportunities are explored and that whatever the GMC is exploring does not conflict with that of Arbitrum partnership teams.\n\n**GMC Deliverables and Expected Timeline**:\n\n* Design and host an RFP process seeking protocol partnerships through the deployment of the DAO’s ETH, which must target the use of ETH itself or ETH-pegged assets. It is possible that these applications will be ongoing rather than a specified time period. Some information may need to remain confidential—this body will follow a similar playbook as the STEP Committee. **Timeline: 4 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Serve as the point of contact/negotiating body for protocol teams interested in a deeper alliance with the Arbitrum DAO. **Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC’s term**\n* As suitable deals arise, make recommendations to the DAO on the forum that can then be confirmed or denied via a Snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. **Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC’s term, or until all funds have been allocated**\n* Coordinate the amplification/marketing of engagements across various Arbitrum contributors, e.g., the Foundation, OCL, protocols, etc. **Timeline: This will coincide with the passing of a deal’s recommendation through Snapshot**\n* Prepare 2 reports over the course of their term for the DAO forum that provide visibility into the status/general success and failures of the growth partnerships being deployed. **Timeline: Reports will only be made following the deployment of ETH into DAO-approved strategies, and will come at a cadence of every 3 months**\n* Evaluate smart contract or general economic risk of potential partnerships before they are proposed to the DAO **Timeline: Case-by-case basis, i.e., as deals arise**\n* Monitor the projects that have received an allocation from the Arbitrum DAO and notify the Arbitrum Foundation of any risks that arise as a result of general market conditions, fundamental, or technical risks. If the OpCo is not at a point where it can absorb/oversee these responsibilities, Entropy will put up a continuation proposal to make sure that risk management capabilities are maintained. **Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC’s term once funds have been deployed**\n  * This is one of the primary motivations for adding Llama Risk to the GMC, as this is work they specialize in.\n\n## Specifications / “Costs”\n\nIn order to reduce ambiguity around tax, legal, and any other possible liabilities, we suggest that the Arbitrum Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds at all times. The TMC and the GMC simply help coordinate the process, the DAO still remains as the ultimate decision maker, and the Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds and thus abides by Cayman Islands law. While the MSS is great for serving as the DAO’s solution to multi-sigs, it is clear that the Arbitrum Foundation is the most logical party to custody these funds, until the OpCo’s legal entity is stood up and fully operational, to avoid unforeseen legal liabilities.&#x20;\n\nIf this vote passes onchain via Tally, 7,500 ETH and 26M ARB will be moved to this [address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xAc20CD734C65Baf48a1476447af7D3E3165DC739#tokentxns), and then transferred to two separate foundation controlled addresses. No funds can be deployed by either the TMC or GMC—they are only tasked with providing options for the DAO to vote on, and the Arbitrum Foundation will be subject to act in accordance with how the DAO votes. The additional 1M ARB being transferred to the Foundation will be liquidated for 300k USDC in the most suitable manner to pay committee members, with the remainder immediately returned to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO can claw back funds at any time via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. It is worth noting that some of the initiatives in the GM track may contain verbiage that prevents the DAO from clawing back a specific allotment of funds. As mentioned, the DAO will ultimately make the decision on these deals, so delegates/voters will need to review and take these factors into account when voting. Again, the GMC members may be under NDA and only be able to disclose what the partner in question is willing to share publicly. As proposed, the GMC will receive assistance from the OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation, and it is equipped with members with strong BD skill sets and risk evaluation experience. Therefore, we feel confident the GMC will only have the DAO’s best interest in mind.\n\nLastly, we want to emphasize that this is not a proposal to spend these funds, so the funds being moved are not actually a “cost” to the DAO. Rather, these funds will be used for diversifying risks and creating yield, laying the groundwork for prudent financial management for the Arbitrum DAO, setting it up for long-term success, sustainability, and growth. The only costs incurred by the DAO from this proposal are those of specific committee members, which equates to 300k USDC if all milestones are achieved. Entropy received overwhelming feedback from both interested committee members and the broader Arbitrum DAO community that the payment needed to be altered from 30k ARB vested over 2 years to a more attractive payment arrangement in order to attract the right people.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1.

Treasury Working Group Call #2 (recording [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7))\n3. September 27, 2024: Treasury Management V1 proposal posted on the Forum\n4. November 14, 2024: Snapshot vote to move forward with Treasury Management V1\n5. December 2nd, 2024: Proposal is moved to Tally\n6. Late-December: If the Tally vote successfully passes, funds will be moved to the Arbitrum Foundation and the TMC/GMC can begin their work.\n\n## Long-term Desires\n\nThis proposal remedies 3 key problems plaguing the Arbitrum DAO today, and sets the stage for all of the DAO’s identified financial management needs being met in the future:\n\n> 1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse’s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n> 2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n> 3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield—consistent with the DAO’s growth-first mindset.\n\nWe envision the functions of the TMC and the GMC to roll up into OpCo once established and fully operationalized, and depending upon the OpCo’s structure, e.g., Cayman Islands Foundation entity, the OpCo could become the custodian of these funds in the future. A lot of the ground work around treasury management will be handled by the TMC and GMC in the interim, and will provide the OpCo with a rubric that can be improved upon as it relates to procuring treasury managers, budgeting, transparency/reporting, etc.\n\nThis is a good starting point as it ensures service providers do not bear the burden of ARB volatility, puts the infrastructure and SPs in place for the DAO to conduct onchain strategies, and generates revenue while spurring growth across the Arbitrum ecosystem.",

    "description": "# OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 30M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 26M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s price of $0.68 as of January 21st, this would require roughly 18M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 30M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"566\" alt=\"Requested ARB\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6ec9b9968091e7de20dd115487e9c09f4c254322_2_566x500.png\" />Requested ARB1450×1280 153 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6ec9b9968091e7de20dd115487e9c09f4c254322.png \"Requested ARB\")\n\n\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo 1\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/173ff0b350b196f8546db6797137e4dd8c08a288_2_690x388.png\" />OpCo 11600×900 135 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/173ff0b350b196f8546db6797137e4dd8c08a288.png \"OpCo 1\")\n\n\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo M\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dbaa8d6981fc1566e7cf02e6137d67b1905d8f15_2_690x388.png\" />OpCo M1600×900 152 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/dbaa8d6981fc1566e7cf02e6137d67b1905d8f15.png \"OpCo M\")\n\n\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs & 12-Month Deliverables\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\nThe two primary, immediate priorities for OpCo should be regarded as follows:\n\n1. Establishing the legal entity\n2. Implementing robust and qualified oversight capabilities (mainly the Oversight and Transparency Committee)\n\nOnce these two components have been achieved, the entity is prepared so that when the OAT and Foundation find the perfect initial employees for OpCo, it will be ready to begin servicing the DAO’s needs, although it will take some additional time for OpCo to ramp up to full capacity. It is important to note that the DAO should not optimize for rushing OpCo to full capacity versus optimizing to have it available for when the OAT finds the right person and the DAO needs it most.\n\nIn the twelve months following OpCo’s official initiation date (i.e., when, among other things, the entity, structure, and initial staffing have been finalized), the entity is expected to achieve the following tasks at minimum, given the DAO still finds them relevant and supports their facilitation by OpCo in the future:\n\n* Establish adequate processes, capabilities, internal controls, and any other relevant functions such that the entity is ready to assume/create contracts with service providers, take on admin work where required, do adequate reporting, and manage new initiatives end-to-end on behalf of the DAO (KYC, payments, etc.)\n* Set up regular touch-points with Arbitrum Stakeholders (delegates, OCL, the Foundation, etc.)\n* Consolidate the TM V1.2 and STEP initiatives into a cohesive strategy that is facilitated with the help of the entity.\n* Given the Watchdog program is ratified through the governance process, absorb the management of the program.\n* Given the SOS framework is ratified through the governance process, manage the subsequent review/ad hoc strategic objective adjustment processes, potentially replacing the research member of the ARDC in creating quarterly reports updating the DAO on the process made with respect to the chosen objectives if delegates so choose.\n* Together with the Foundation, formulate a synergistic plan for DAO communications (internal and external), branding, and marketing, as well as hire personnel/contract vendors if required.\n* Absorb the Events Budget initiative and formulate/manage an events strategy for the DAO, again, working together with the Foundation.\n* Design and implement a financials and deliverables (whether programs are developing in line with what was initially expected/communicated) reporting structure for all relevant DAO programs.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the Arbitrum DAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the Arbitrum DAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass the onchain voting stage, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an onchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n## OAT Applicant Requirements\n\nApplicants must be individuals, not entities, and should possess familiarity with the Arbitrum DAO, governance processes, multisig operations, and a strong industry reputation. Additionally, candidates should demonstrate substantial experience and expertise in one or more of the following fields:\n\n1. Corporate Finance & Financial Management\n   * Treasury Management\n   * Finance / Accounting / Budgeting\n2. Operations & Strategy\n   * (DAO) Operations / Business Development / Growth / Strategy\n   * Procurement / HR / People\n   * Crypto Law / Compliance\n\nWhen applying to become an OAT member, applicants should specify the primary domain(s) from the list above in which they have the most experience and describe the nature of that experience. More details about candidates’ desired skill sets and professional experience, as well as an application template, will be posted by Entropy Advisors if the onchain vote to signal approval of OpCo passes.\n\n## OAT Compensation Structure\n\nOAT members must be properly compensated, highly incentivized to commit their full attention to the outlined responsibilities, and aligned with Arbitrum DAO’s long-term success. OAT members’ base monthly payment is $7.5K (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation in its role as an observer). An additional 1M ARB vesting bonus payment will be allocated to OAT members (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation in its role as an observer) to ensure long-term alignment and fair compensation. At the end of the first OAT term, 50% of this ARB would be sent to a vesting contract that would release the funds after a 24-month cliff following the first OAT term’s end. Each individual who is an active member when the OAT term ends and was appointed as part of the dedicated election process will be allocated an equal share of the funds (100K ARB). If an OAT member steps down or is removed, they become ineligible for the bonus, in which case that ARB would be allocated pro rata to the replacing member. For example, if the initial OAT term’s length is 14 months and a replacement member is appointed with 7 months remaining in the initial term, they would be eligible to receive a bonus of 50K ARB subject to the same vesting terms as outlined above. The other 500K ARB will be allocated in a similar manner as described above for the second OAT term.\n\n## Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT\n\nThe non-exhaustive list of governance and compliance obligations for OpCo, its internal employees, and OAT members comprises:\n\n* Bound to be aligned with the community values listed in The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO, be committed to prioritizing the Arbitrum DAO’s needs, and act in absolute good faith and utmost honesty to fulfill their duties to the best of their abilities.\n* Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n* Have to go through a KYC process and enter into an Agreement with the OpCo legal entity. The Agreement will cover, including but not limited to, appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, confidentiality, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards.\n* Required to sign any relevant non-disclosure agreements with respect to confidential information they might gain access to as part of their duties.\n* Bound to follow the Code of Conduct for delegates.\n* Internal full-time employees (not OAT members): these individuals, as well as any companies and analogous entities with which these individuals maintain a professional or financial relationship, are forbidden from participating in Arbitrum DAO governance votes.\n* OpCo in its capacity as a legal entity: the entity is prohibited from becoming a delegate and cannot assume token delegations.\n\n## OpCo Financials and Costs\n\nOpCo’s budget is intended to fund its initial 30-month term, with funds covering the entity’s legal setup, any outsourced professional services required for operations such as legal counsel and accounting/auditing services, other incurred operating expenses such as business-critical software and insurance, internal full-time employee salaries, and the OAT’s salaries.\n\nThis proposal would earmark 30M ARB to cover OpCo’s initial term, with an exemplary budget breakdown shown below. This is not an official budget, meaning that capital may be budgeted and allocated differently once the entity is stood up. For example, Employee #4 doesn’t have to be hired at a yearly salary of ~$130K. The exemplary budget’s purpose is instead to showcase that the ask isn’t arbitrary, and how the figure has been derived. It’s also important to note that several line items, such as entity setup and legal services are notably larger than what the actual expenses are expected to be. This was done to account for any unforeseen events or worst-case scenarios which could require notable capital commitments.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"387\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo Exemplary Budget\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/892e776d01c06f75b574ea7361591b03cde22a7a_2_690x387.jpeg\" />OpCo Exemplary Budget1920×1079 232 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/892e776d01c06f75b574ea7361591b03cde22a7a.jpeg \"OpCo Exemplary Budget\")\n\n\n\nFunds will be transferred to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled address, with 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee. Again, if bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based. Of the remaining 26M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s price of $0.68 as of January 21, this would require roughly 18M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following this proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact. After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 30M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\nOf the $12M worth of cash equivalents, $2.5M will be released upfront. Once OpCo’s legal setup and related aspects are finalized, the entity can draw up to $500K each month. If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds. If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\nResidual ARB (as well as capital in other denominations) will be sent back to the DAO treasury at the end of OpCo’s first term if the initiative isn’t renewed. Otherwise, the budget will be rolled over. ARB associated with this initiative, held by OpCo or the Arbitrum Foundation, is prohibited from being used in governance and must be delegated to the Exclude Address wherever practicable such that these funds don’t count towards the quorum. The Chief of Coins, together with relevant parties, will be responsible for maintaining an adequate runway for covering expenses as well as establishing a low-risk management strategy for idle capital to enhance the impact of the allocated funds.\n\nThe DAO will have the capability to clawback OpCo’s funding at any time. Defunding OpCo entirely by the DAO requires a forum post outlining the rationale behind the request for change, allowing for a reasonable time for discussion, and a subsequent Temperature Check vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If a Snapshot vote to defund OpCo is passed, payments will immediately be halted and all earmarked funds returned to the DAO Treasury, with OpCo ceasing operations.\n\n# Voting Structure\n\nThe vote will utilize Basic Voting:\n\n* FOR: Establish OpCo.\n* AGAINST: Do not establish OpCo.\n* ABSTAIN\n\n# Timeline\n\n1. October 30 - December 12, 2024: OpCo forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions.\n2. December 12 - December 19, 2024: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval of OpCo, with the clear majority voting FOR.\n3. January 7 - January 22, 2025: Hold a community call to gather the last round of feedback and make final edits.\n4. \\~ January 30 - February 13, 2025: Tally proposal to fund OpCo. Capital will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled address.\n5. \\~21 days: Application period for the 3 DAO-elected OAT members. Entropy Advisors will handle application template creation and will be ready to post after the above Tally vote is complete. It is worth noting that if at least 3 suitably qualified individuals do not apply within the ~3 weeks, this application period may be extended. These are critical contributors to the DAO’s operations, and the process of finding the right candidates should not be rushed.\n6. 7 days: Snapshot to elect the 3 OAT members. Once chosen, the 3 members will KYC with the Foundation, sign any required NDAs, and begin searching for the 2 additional members, who will also go through a similar KYC process and sign the required NDAs (all OAT members will sign a contract with OpCo once the legal entity is finalized). After all OAT members are KYCd and the required NDAs have been signed, they will begin the recruitment process for the Chief Chaos Coordinator and Chief of Coins.\n7. TBD: When the legal entity is finalized and the required internal employees have been contracted, OpCo will begin operationalizing and executing according to its mandate.",

    "description": "# Non-Constitutional: Stable Treasury Endowment Program 2.0\n# Abstract\n\nThis vote authorizes transfer of another 35 million ARB to a wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation for the next edition of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program ([STEP](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919)), to diversify Arbitrum DAOs treasury into real world assets that are stable in value, liquid in conversion and have yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal kickstarts the second edition of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification).\n\nThe RWA sector is growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. Arbitrum has [grown](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors/status/1869053544164380848) from only $100k of RWAs in the beginning of 2024 to around [$150 million](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) today! Only 18% of this volume has come from the DAO itself through STEP 1, with the remaining TVL growing via organic means. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.\n\nAt the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. STEP follows 3 clear principles in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;\n\n* Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).\n\nThe STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected products\n\n* Diversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a highly competitive and rigorous  process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a provider is as valuable as the business they get\n\nAccordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get included\n\n* Take advantage of rising markets to steadily build up an endowment that can cover ARB DAO expenses from yield earned.\n\nPassage of this proposal will bring our endowment near the $60 million mark: $30 million from STEP 1, ~$10-15 million from the [treasury management initiative](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) and now STEP 2\n\n# Rationale\n\nIn mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO [diversified](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-committee-recommendations/25097/36) $30 million into stable, liquid & yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $875k for our treasury (live dashboard to track yield [here](https://dune.com/steakhouse/step-dashboard))\n\nThe 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments). STEP 2 will have a similar scope of products. We explored other markets but see biggest benefit in Arbitrum doubling down on the same instruments as STEP 1 and exploring other RWA sectors after they have had time to mature. After all, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are still U.S. Treasuries\n\nOverall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;\n\n* Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and projects in this sector should build on our chain, by building a regular cadence to the STEP program as the flagship program for RWA support\n* Let the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses by sweeping it as USDC to the ARB DAO treasury.\n* Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution and take advantage of tailwinds when they arise for diversifying the treasury. Building up an endowment will let us weather even bear markets from an abundance mindset.\n\n# Specifications\n\n* We will transfer 35 million ARB to a foundation managed wallet (0x54FE3425f09854E15081fa5B3276afCB4C46FCa2). See confirmation here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-stable-treasury-endowment-program-2-0/26819/81\n* The foundation will at their discretion liquidate the ARB and once complete, announce the average conversion price on the forum\n* Service providers who applied in STEP 1 will have to simply communicate what has changed in their product. Ample feedback was provided to all applicants, so if they have not managed to address the concerns we do not need to re-review applicants. New applications will be reviewed fresh. The RFP will be similar as STEP 1 with some modifications that will be included in the tally vote.\n* The committee may at their discretion review investments made in STEP 1 and propose re-allocations from providers selected in the earlier edition. High preference will be given to providers that already have their RWA product launched on Arbitrum.\n* The selection committee will be same as last time with one major change: Entropy will replace Steakhouse Financial who will not be a voting member due to also being the STEP program manager.\n\nSo the committee will be composed of @GFXlabs , @northlakeslegal , @Nethermind , @Entropy and @karpatkey , with Devansh Mehta from the Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Group as non-voting facilitating member (except in case of tie) to communicate with service providers, the DAO and the foundation. As program manager of STEP, [@steakhouse](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/steakhouse) will be privy to committee discussions as an observing member but not have decision making power.\n\n* Funds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAO\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* A snapshot vote approving in principle a STEP 2 for first half of 2025\n* A tally vote with the RFP service providers can apply under that authorizes transfer of funds from the treasury to a Foundation controlled wallet\n* Call for applications from service providers\n* Committee review of applications\n* DAO approval of committee recommendations on Snapshot\n\nTimeline\n\nForum Discussion: September-December\nJanuary: Snapshot vote (COMPLETE)\nJanuary 28th: Put for vote on Tally\nFebruary 20th to March 20th: Call for Applications\nMarch 20th to April 20th: Committee Review\nMay 1st: DAO Ratification of Committee Recommendations on Snapshot\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nDiversification budget: 35 million ARB, same as STEP 1\nImplementation budget: 125k ARB\n\nSimilar to STEP 1, a rate of 25k ARB x 5 committee members (GFX, Northlake, Nethermind, Karpatkey and Devansh Mehta from the Arbitrum T\\&S WG as facilitating member; Entropy to waive compensation)\n\n10k ARB will be given upon completion of work and the remaining 15k ARB will be vested over 3 years  using Hedgey so that it can be delegated to increase voting power.\n\nRough budget estimates\n50 applications\n2 hours for 25 applications with few updates.\n6 hours for remaining 25 new products/drastic changes.\nTotal: 200 hours.\nAnother 20 or so hours for all the deliberation, selections, allocation decisions we have within the committee.\nAverage rate of $100-$150/hr would be between 25-33K, downsized to 25k ARB (10k on completion and 15k over 3 years).&#x20;\n\nWhile the price of ARB is now lower, we are keeping the same amount of 25k ARB so as to not deviate from the pay received in  STEP 1.\n\nSTEP has developed a reputation of having a ton of due diligence. We think this is a good flag to hold high, since the benefits from being a STEP recipient go beyond just the amounts we allocate to also the legitimacy of passing heavy scrutiny by our committee. Service providers have also expressed appreciation on the feedback they got on their product, which in many cases led to different design decisions by their team.\n\n# RFP for STEP 2\n\nFor products that applied under STEP 1 and wish to re-apply, we ask that they comment under their old application in the Arbitrum governance forum with the following details;\n\n1. Start with a table of changes narrating all that’s different compared to last time. If you would like to know the reason for rejection in STEP 1, message [@TheDevanshMehta](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/thedevanshmehta) on telegram.\n2. In the application form, whatever details have changed should be in a different color or highlighted in some fashion so the committee can easily know what is the same as last time and what is new.\n3. Updated and latest documents that you prefer not made public on the forum but which you want the committee to consider should be sent to [rwa@dao.arbitrum.foundation](mailto:rwa@dao.arbitrum.foundation)\n\nFor new applicants, we ask that they create a new thread on the forum with their application here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/step-applications/\n\n**Who Should NOT apply**\n\nFollowing learnings from the first edition of the program, we advise the following products to refrain from applying;\n\n* Proportion of RWA is less & de-fi or crypto angle too high\n* Involves equities having high volatility\n* Not dollar denominated with foreign currency risk\n* A derivative product or wrapper that is majorly built from other onchain RWAs\n* Not launched yet\n* Requires bridging to other chains. As the Arbitrum RWA space has matured since STEP 1, high priority will be given to products launched on Arbitrum by March 15th 2025\n* Requires continual active decision making & operationally burdensome, for example individual issuances maturing without auto-roll\n* Transparency issues such as: black box setups, multisig in control of executive team without legal protections, product is complicated with risk difficult to quantify.\n* Products with a tiny AUM, exposure to a single ISIN or having fund managers without extensive prior experience or outsourced to third parties\n* Insufficient separation between fund manager and investment manager\n* No investment restrictions, especially worrisome if a provider can use leverage and hedging at discretion of the manager. We need something beyond common sense that stops a provider from taking our money and putting it into Argentinian peso bonds.\n* Insufficient documentation such as not providing a PPM, investment memo, counterparty for reverse repos, guidelines, restrictions, having annual audits only or from unknown auditors or managers\n* Redemption procedures have a lag period measured in weeks or months or are limited to a single stablecoin that is not USDC, USDT or DAI or require a bank transfer\n* Decentralized governance of underlying assets which require additional due diligence and/or have exposure to the Foundation add an extra layer of unpredictability\n* Judged as not being bankruptcy remote, opening risk of creditors taking our funds in case of disputes. This criteria includes both service providers in a jurisdiction that is uncomfortable for the committee and segregated portfolio companies with multiple portfolios.\n\nBankruptcy remote is not just having separate bank accounts, creditors look at whether entities are in actuality separate (their own board meeting minutes, payroll with staff, etc) so that the subsidiary entities do not get rolled into the parent one during proceedings.\n\nIf you think all these criteria are met, please read the application form below to send in your application.\n\n# Request For Proposals: Arbitrum Treasury Diversification (STEP 2)\n\nTable of contents\n\n1.

Supplementary\n\n**Summary and Arbitrum info**\n\nIntroduction Arbitrum governance is seeking proposals from qualified applicants for the purposes of diversifying the governance treasury and supporting ecosystem growth.\n\nThe purpose of the RFP is to identify products that provide trading volume and depth (i.e., liquidity), are stable in value, produce income for governance independent of crypto market volatility, offer transparency, and can potentially see use in developing a nascent “real-world assets” sector on Arbitrum chains.\n\nApplicants whose products meet certain quality thresholds will be presented to ARB holders and their delegates for possible asset allocation. All final asset allocation decisions rest with ARB holders and their representatives. This RFP is intended to both collect relevant information for the committee and also to recommend allocations for tokenholders to vote upon.\n\n**Requester background**\n\nArbitrum governance maintains and upgrades the Arbitrum technology stack, upon which are built multiple blockchains, including the largest Layer 2 on Ethereum, with more than $2.8b in assets onchain.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Asset information**\n\nThis program is intended to convert 35,000,000 ARB into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. The dollar notional amount of this investment is subject to market volatility, but at the time of January 16th 2025 is valued at approximately $26.46 million. These assets do not have a specific futured obligation or liability they are matched against. The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands legal entity, will be the transacting counterparty.\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe committee is comprised of 6 members including GFX Labs, Entropy Advisors, Karpatkey, Nethermind, and North Lakes Legal. The Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group also serves as a non-voting member of the committee, except in the case of ties. As program manager of STEP 1, Steakhouse Financial is an observing member of the committee privy to discussions.\n\nAll members are required to recuse themselves for any application in which they have a monetary interest, direct or indirect.\n\nThe Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group leads this process and answers to stakeholders within Arbitrum governance.\n\n**Scope of service/criteria**\n\nPlease include the following as part of your proposal: Sample or template investment contract and the governing instrument (credit agreement, partnership agreement, etc.). Investment selection, monitoring, and reporting plan. Compliance requirements. Be specific about requirements you anticipate from Arbitrum governance.\n\n**RFP process overview**\n\nRFP Timeline, 2025\n\nSubmissions open : Feb 20th\nSubmissions deadline : March 20th\nFinalists announced : April 20th\nARB holders vote on proposed allocation : May 1st\n\n**Participants**\n\nThis RFP will be open to all applicants with a stable, liquid and yield earning product. The screening committee will review all submissions and announce allocation between finalists for ARB tokenholders to vote upon.\n\nAfter receiving applications, the committee will prepare an allocation policy for distribution to applicants and recommend a split between them. The DAO will then vote on whether to approve the split or not. Funds will be given to providers in stablecoins or fiat transfers after signing agreements with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Questionnaire**\n\n**Applicant information**\n\nName\n\nAddress (Headquarters)\n\nCity, State, Postal Code\n\nCountry\n\nWebsite\n\nPrimary contact Name\n\nTitle\n\nCountry\n\nEmail, Telegram, Forum, & other methods of contact\n\nKey Information\n\nExpected Yield\n\nExpected Maturity\n\nUnderlying asset\n\nMinimum/Maximum transaction size\n\nCurrent AUM for product\n\nCurrent AUM for issuer\n\nVolume of transactions LTM\n\nSource of first-loss capital\n\n**Basics and background**\n\n1.

The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) with the addition of a fifth domain (Orbit), as per the[ <u>snapshot vote</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x052d7e9872192f46bfb4e0a2aabd07035d0842811ca1c82d654307b5d96e2e25). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n## **Season 1 and 2 recap**\n\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in[ <u>April 2023</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful[ <u>snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and[ <u>tally</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of[ <u>JoJo</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary),[ <u>SEEDGov</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary),[ <u>Flook</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary) and[ <u>Juandi</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with[ <u>Srijith</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was[ <u>renewed</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 140\n    * Amount of completed projects: 66 / 47%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 71 / 51%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 2 / 1.5%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 1 / 0.5%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 506\n    * Amount of completed milestones 357 / 71%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 149 / 29%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,841,027 / 92%\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $2,067,492 / 67%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $773,535 / 25%\n\nMore details on the results can be found[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n## **Season 3: overview**\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the[ <u>winner</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and[ <u>runner-up</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's[ <u>Governance Dashboard</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially[ <u>rejected</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their[ <u>API module</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x538\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has[ <u>bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x4ee\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true)<u> </u>in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen[ <u>support to their compiler in Season 2</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the[ <u>discoverability of projects with incentives</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four base domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, plus further $750,000 for the Orbit domain, for a total of $6,750,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea. As mentioned below, we will also introduce a rule for which 10-20% (precise amount to be determined after internal discussion with the new team) of the overall grant will only be released after the completion of this further step, pending evaluation of the specific DA. This will ensure that projects will comply in drafting the documents requested by the grant, and ensure a better retention of projects after completion.\n\nBefore the natural completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**Program phases**\n![Phases\\_of\\_the\\_program](https://static.tally.xyz/87a4bc29-1851-427b-9dfe-3d3293de2190_original.png \"Phases of the program\")\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n\n* the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n* the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n* the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n* any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## **Domains**\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders’ feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### **Education, Community Growth and Events**\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won’t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### **Gaming**\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### **Dev Tooling on One and Stylus**\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn’t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn’t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can’t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn’t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram’s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### **New Protocols and Ideas**\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### **Orbit Chains**\n\nThe successful snapshot vote confirmed the willingness to not only renew the program for a third season, but also enlarge the scope with a fifth domain, which will allow for the creation of an Orbit track.\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the[ <u>2024-205 Offchain Labs roadmap</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966)\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won’t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn’t mean that a project can’t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can’t be the main focus of the proposal. The rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([<u>1</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42),[ <u>2</u>](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32),[ <u>3</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt),[ <u>4</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)), and will be ready by the start of the new season of D.A.O. grants.\n\n## **Modularity**\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that new tracks may operate with their own independent teams.\n\n## **What does success look like**\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects nine months after the natural end of that very season.\n\n## **Resignation of DAs and PMs**\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## **Budget**\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", and $750,000 for the “Orbit” domain,  for a total amount of $6,750,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving by an address controlled by the Arbitrum, Foundation, will be then converted into USDC. Costs are listed below; it is worth mentioning that these compensations are based on a standard hourly rate of $100 per hour, with the commitment of DAs being around 80 hours per month, and the commitment of the PM being between 60 to 80 hours per month.\n\nQuestbook Platform: $60,000 total ($5,000/month for 12 months)\n\n* Includes platform maintenance, improvements and bug management\n* Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n* DocuSign subscription\n\nDomain Allocator Compensation: $528,000 total\n\n* $8,000/month for 12 months (five DAs)\\*\n* Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n\nProgram Manager Compensation: $85,800 + 25,000 ARB\n\n* 25,000 ARB released upon successful voting\\*\\*\n* $6,500/month for 12 months\n* Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n\nLegal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked.\n\nTotal operational costs: $703,800 + 25,000 ARB.\n\n*\\* If this on-chain vote is approved, JoJo, Juandi, SeedGOV, Flook, will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3.*\n\n*\\*\\* the 25,000 ARB will be delegated by*[\\*\\* <u>JoJo</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/JoJo/summary) *to*[\\*\\* <u>himself</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0x4f685b29514eed0c9d929386e86d9cd81981118b)*<u>, and will be held as such for at least 180 days after the official start of the program.</u>*\n\n## **Reporting**\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward. Specifically\n\n* The PM will report, once per month, in the Arbitrum Governance call\n* This type of reporting might change format and/or schedule: if the DAO is interested, for example, it could be a specific DA call, or it might fall into any of the new governance DAO’s calls that we could change or spin up in future\n* The PM and the DAs will publish, once per month, a single unified report highlighting the status of the program\n* All grantees, of all domains, at completion will have to publish a report in the Arbitrum forum\n* All grantees will have to follow up the aforementioned report, after three months, with a survey prepared to understand the effectiveness of both the grant itself and the idea from the team, including but not only understanding if the team has decided to keep building in Arbitrum, expanding in other chains etcetera.\n\n## **Operational changes**\n\nWhile in general there has been a very good reception of Season 1 and 2, there have been several feedback on how to improve the program moving forward. Addressing the gaps highlighted can be translated in three major areas of improvements.\n\n**Grantees Accountability**\n\nIt’s clear that the DAO wants to have better results from the program, where better can be defined, among others, as more \"stickiness\" of teams that participate in the program, less frauds and scam which can be unfortunately quite common in low sized grant programs, and in general better results over time. For better accountabilities of the team these changes will be introduced.\n\n* KYC: it will be mandatory for two people on the team. The signed document will have to match one of the identities of the KYC members who kyced. This will add friction on whoever tries to impersonate others\n* Identity verification disclaimers: a clause will be included when filing for a grant, in which a team might optionally need to participate in video calls with the DAs with camera turned on. Failing to do so might lead to be rejected for the grant\n* Completion milestone: to increase the incentives for grantees to complete their proposal and to complete both the final report and the followup questionnaire, up to 15-20% of the grant will be released 3 months after the final milestone, pending evaluation from the main DA which will take in account the success of the project. In this way, not only we will have the complete documentation from the grantee, but also we will guarantee that a portion of the grant goes to teams that effectively keep going with their activity 3 months after the release of their product.\n\n**Improvement in operations for the program and the Domain Allocators**\n\nThere have been reports and feedback on how the DAs can better operate, and how the program could also improve through technological enhancements, to guarantee more quality in the program. The following will be implemented.\n\n* More in depth guideline for due diligence for DAs: DAs are not in the business of being on-chain sleuths or OSINT researchers, and so far most of due diligence was just based on the single experience of the person involved. Thanks to Entropy, we have worked together on a set of easy to follow but comprehensive guidelines to do due diligence on projects. This will give more confidence on the teams in the program being genuine.\n* Improvements in transaction execution time: to avoid bottlenecks in releasing grants, the structure of safes will be changed from the previous 2/2 to a 2/3 for each domain, with the main two signers being the respective DA and the PM, and a third backup signer being another DA. To increase security, any specific pair of DAs won’t be a signer of multiple safes.\n* Improvement in how the Questbook platform generates the transactions: to mitigate and possibly avoid cases such as double transactions, we will require the Questbook team to improve the generation of transactions through their platform. Specifically, the message that is generated by signing a milestone directly in the platform won’t be encoded but will be in clear text for the DAs to have a further way to verify that the milestone queued is the right one, as well as some other improvements such as checking if the address input by grantees is formatted in the right way for the system to ingest it.\n* Secondary ledger: the PM will keep a manually updated spreadsheet with all the transactions generated for each project.\n\n**Compliance to future DAO changes**\n\nOur DAO is evolving, and this is the first time we will have a one year long program. The current trend seems to indicate how several delegates might want to move toward a general standardization of oversight and reporting in Arbitrum. For these reasons, the following will be implemented.\n\n* Standardized communication format implementation: while the PM will regularly communicate to the DAO on a monthly basis through the governance calls and with a unified report consistent across all domains, the communications might change in the future in case the DAO will agree on a general standardized format cross-program.\n* Future oversight council compliance: as for comms, in case the DAO will agree on a general unified oversight unit, the program will adhere to it.\n\n## **Steps to Implement and Timeline**\n\n* 06th of February: Starts of the on-chain vote\n* 20th of February: end of the on-chain vote\n* 1st of March: official start of Season 3 of D.A.O. Grant Program\n\n## **Fund Management**\n\nThe proposal is requesting a total 23,426,465 ARB tokens, equivalent to the $6,750,000 for the 5 domains and the $703,800 for OpEx, including 35% as buffer at the current price of $0.43 per ARB token. In the aforementioned amount is also included the 25,000 ARB bonus. The 23,426,465 ARB will be sent to the address 0xb9a05fCcc841202f1ee0dEee557C6abE5cbb6615 controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation, which will send 25,000 ARB to 0x4F685B29514eed0c9D929386E86D9cd81981118B and take care of convertion of the tokens in USDC up to the requested amount of $7,453,800. Any surplus fund will be returned to the DAO:Upon completion, funds will be split as per the following\n\n* OpEx safe: managed by the MSS, it will be in charge of payment of suppliers and partners (Questbook, Synapse) and salaries\n* Domains’ safes: managed by PM + DAs, one for each vertical with a 2/3 setup (the PM, the main DA, and a second different DA), will be linked to the specific domain through the Questbook website and will be used to disburse the grants. The safes will have the Zodiac Module for the clawback of funds.",

    "description": "# Request to Increase the Stylus Sprint Committee’s Budget\n### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\n* The Stylus Sprint program saw overwhelming demand, with 147 applications requesting ~31.92 million ARB, significantly exceeding the initial budget.\n* This proposal requests an **additional 4 million ARB** to extend the committee’s original budget. The funds will enable the evaluation committee to fund a set of exceptional applications that were excluded due to budget constraints.\n* The committee has provided the list of applicants that it strongly recommends deserve to be funded as part of the Sprint, in addition to the 5M ARB already [allocated](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294). Rationale and a summary of the applicants is linked in the proposal.\n* We will be moving this request to **Snapshot next Thursday, February 6th**. If approved, an onchain vote will move forward the following Thursday as to not further disrupt the proposed timelines of the applicants.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\nWith 147 applications and ~31.92 million ARB in funding requests, demand for the Stylus Sprint program significantly exceeded expectations. The committee received a large number of exceptional applications, but unfortunately, due to the initial budget constraints, the committee was only able to fund 17 applications. They were chosen based on a combination of factors including cost, timeline, necessity for immediate start, RFP category importance, and the priority to fund both applications and infrastructure/tooling.\n\nWhile the committee has [accepted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294) a subset of the applicants, there remains an important opportunity to support impactful ideas and high-quality teams. With Stylus as one of Arbitrum’s strongest competitive advantages, the committee strongly believes that enabling all impressive applications received as a part of the Stylus Sprint with funding is a worthwhile investment for the DAO.\n\nThis proposal seeks an additional allocation of 4 million ARB tokens to extend funding opportunities to promising projects that were not initially accepted into the Sprint. With this budget extension, the committee will be able to fund an additional group of applicants, outlined in detail below. While there are many more strong applications, the recommended list scored especially high during the review process and are ones that the committee is confident have the potential to provide value to the Arbitrum and Stylus ecosystems.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAs stated in the original Stylus Sprint proposal, large requests may be directed to the DAO directly to request funding. This process was communicated to applicants, some of which elected to go this route over reducing their request. The smaller applicants in this list are in the committee’s opinion worthwhile investments that have the potential to improve Stylus long-term.\n\nThe following list of applicants are the ones that come with a strong recommendation from the committee and to reiterate were unable to be accepted due to budget constraints.\n\nOpen Application\n\n1.

The committee is aware of some applicants that may bring revised versions and/or lower budgets than when they were originally reviewed. While we appreciate that Arbitrum DAO’s open and decentralized essence provides the freedom to make such requests, we’d encourage delegates to be mindful of the possible precedent funding projects circumventing the program would set. When appropriate, the committee has already directed certain applications to be on the look out for alternative DAO programs, such as the Season 3 of [Arbitrum D.A.O](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-rfc-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program-season-3/27584) program if it’s approved.\n\nIf this proposed extension is approved on Snapshot, we will move it immediately to an onchain vote the following Thursday, February 20th. The recommended applicants will be held to the current Stylus Sprint timeline, so the committee would like to not unnecessarily delay the ability to fund these projects. Projects funded as part of the Stylus Sprint’s budget increase will benefit from the infrastructure already in place as far as MSS/payments and milestone reviews by the evaluation committee.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe Stylus Sprint committee is requesting an **additional 4,000,000 ARB** to extend its Stylus Sprint budget.

    "description": "# [NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Arbitrum Onboarding V2: A Governance Bootcamp\nOn December 12, 2024, the Snapshot vote to launch the [<u>Arbitrum Governance Bootcamp</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb5bbd23c20a480dc46f750112b6cc8f1d1825e40cdd0fc12f4ac3642b18f6740) successfully passed. \n\nOne area of feedback questioned the level of interest in protocol matching. In response, we’re pleased to share that Areta, Event Horizon, Gains Network, Gitcoin, Tally, Plutus DAO, and Uniswap Foundation are eager to work with a Governance Fellow to support their governance needs and strengthen their alignment with the DAO. If your organization is interested in working with a Governance Fellow, please complete [<u>this survey</u>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWmKWngdL4PHoZ6nFNEVnHPo1LLJ0pD_F2n2WfvQ-my3k2sg/viewform?usp=sharing). \n\nTo ensure the program is impactful, we’ve taken a data-driven approach, gathering insights from 14 Arbitrum stakeholders — including protocols and service providers — on their needs, pain points, and priorities for working with a Governance Fellow. These findings have shaped curriculum refinements and additional program improvements to better serve the DAO. \n\nThe rest of this update will highlight the changes that we have made between the Snapshot vote and the ongoing Tally vote. \n\n**Note**: We have created [<u>a Chatbot</u>](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6769c0f8f3508191aed172caf8b5aa7d-arbitrum-governance-bootcamp-chatbot) to assist you with reviewing the details of the proposal.&#x20;\n\nThe full Snapshot proposal is included at the end.&#x20;\n\n## **Changes Made Since Snapshot**\n\n### **Team Updates**\n\nWe’re thrilled to welcome Bhaumik Patel, founder of [<u>Atrium Academy</u>](https://atrium.academy/uniswap#hero), as an advisor to our team! Atrium Academy, a Uniswap Foundation grantee, builds immersive cohort-based experiences for advanced solidity developers, with a focus on V4 hooks. See [<u>this case study</u>](https://atrium.academy/case-study) and this [<u>hooks directory </u>](https://hooks.atrium.academy/uniswap-hook-directory)to learn more about Atrium and its impact. \n\nWith deep experience building and shipping educational programs, both at Atrium Academy and in previous roles, Bhaumik brings invaluable insights to the Onboarding Working Group. He has already been instrumental in enhancing our operations and refining the curriculum.\n\nMeanwhile, Manu and Angela have transitioned to new roles elsewhere. \n\n### **Program Updates**\n\n1\\. Open call for workshop facilitators\n\n* We will launch an open call for applications, inviting anyone in the DAO to apply to facilitate workshops aligned with their subject matter expertise.\n\n2\\. Curriculum refinement based on survey responses. \n\n* The program has been tailored to have a greater focus on practical training and exercises that directly address the challenges and priorities of DAO delegates. \n\n3.  A **smaller budget** (see budget [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HW7ESeDLNn5oeNvt5D1dxtP7lVL8ed-MIwkxtU9T-dc/edit?usp=sharing)). \n\n* The budget has decreased $21,657 since the Snapshot proposal.\n\n### **Curriculum Refinement**\n\nWe made the following changes to the curriculum based on survey responses to better align with delegate needs:\n\n**1. Governance Goals & Strategic Alignment**\n\nDelegates identified two primary goals with their governance participation:\n\n* Advocating for initiatives that align with their entity’s objectives.\n* Building relationships with delegates and ecosystem participants.\n\nTo support these goals, we have added a workshop on **Strategic Governance** that will cover the following topics:\n\n* How different DAO stakeholders approach governance.\n* Mapping entity goals to DAO objectives.\n* Identifying governance proposals that align with strategic priorities.\n* Structuring proposal narratives to align with broader DAO goals.\n\n**2. Governance Fellow Support & Key Responsibilities**\n\nDelegates highlighted the following areas where Governance Fellows can add the most value:\n\n* Proposal Management & Tracking – Support in organizing, monitoring, and documenting proposals and initiatives.\n* Participation in DAO-wide Calls & Summarization – Support in having a presence and sharing information.\n* Grant & Funding Opportunities – Help in identifying and applying for relevant grants.\n\nTo address these needs, we have added the following workshops:\n\n1. **Governance Reports & Dashboards** – Teaching participants how to synthesize, analyze, and present governance data effectively.\n2. **Governance Project Management** – Covering best practices for tracking governance initiatives, including hands-on experience with project management tools and frameworks.\n\n**3. Enhancing Visibility & Influence in the DAO**\n\nSome respondents noted challenges in gaining visibility and influence within the DAO. To help address this, we have added the following workshop:\n\n* **DAO Relationship Management** – A workshop designed to help participants build credibility, expand their network, and engage strategically with key DAO stakeholders. This session will cover:\n  * Effective communication strategies\n  * Relationship-building with key stakeholders\n  * Navigating DAO dynamics\n  * Leveraging governance communication platforms\n\nAdditionally, the Onboarding Working Group will offer Fellows 1:1 office hours during their Fellowship for personalized support.\n\n## **Schedule**\n\n| **Week** | **Workshop Title**              |\n| -------- | ------------------------------- |\n| 1        | Arbitrum DAO Governance Basics  |\n| 2        | Strategic Governance            |\n| 3        | Governance Reports & Dashboards |\n| 4        | Governance Project Management   |\n| 5        | Arbitrum Tech Deep Dive         |\n| 6        | DAO Relationship Management     |\n| 7        | Work on Exercises               |\n| 8        | Work on Exercises               |\n\nParticipants will have access to video tutorials and additional reference materials created by the Onboarding Working Group. All workshops will be recorded. \n\nDetailed workshop materials are available in the Appendix.\n\n## **Exercises**\n\nAt the conclusion of the six-week workshop series, participants will have two weeks to complete practical exercises, applying the knowledge they have gained.\n\nThe top 10 submissions will have the opportunity to be matched with an Arbitrum Protocol or Service Provider, where they will gain real-world governance experience as Governance Fellows.\n\nParticipants who are not selected for matching will be invited to join the next cohort on a fast-track basis, bypassing the application and interview process. This creates a positive feedback loop, ensuring multiple opportunities for individuals to engage with Arbitrum governance and contribute meaningfully over time. Each cohort will feature updated content and refined sessions to enhance the learning experience.\n\nThe next section provides sample exercises, which may be adjusted to better align with the evolving needs of the DAO.\n\n### **Sample Exercises**\n\nThese exercises provide Governance Trainees with hands-on experience in core governance activities—commenting on forum posts, analyzing proposals, and engaging in DAO-wide calls—while also increasing their visibility on social media and the Governance Forum.\n\nThe exercises are designed to address the governance needs of onboarded Service Providers and Protocols, incorporating insights from collected survey responses.\n\n### **Graduation & Matching Criteria**\n\nTo graduate and be eligible for matching with a Protocol, Governance Trainees must complete all five mandatory exercises. Bonus points will be awarded for completing optional exercises.\n\n### **Mandatory Exercises**\n\n**1. Draft and submit a proposal idea**\n\n* Based on the DAO’s vision, goals, and strategy, trainees will create a proposal idea and submit it for feedback in the Governance Forum.\n* This group exercise (3-4 participants) fosters engagement with the governance process and alignment with DAO priorities.\n\n**2.Analyze a recent governance proposal**\n\n* Explain how different stakeholders (service providers, protocols, delegates) might vote on it.\n* This helps trainees understand governance dynamics and stakeholder decision-making processes.\n\n**3.Engage in Governance Forum discussions**\n\n* Comment on at least three different proposals with thoughtful feedback or questions.\n* Encourages active participation in governance discussions.\n\n**4.Attend an Open Discussion of Proposals call & share insights**\n\n* Join a live governance discussion and write a recap on X.\n* Encourages active participation in governance discussions.\n\n**5.Identify and summarize a grant opportunity**\n\n* Research and summarize a grant program within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Delegates identified sourcing grant opportunities as a governance need, making this a valuable skill for Governance Fellows.\n\n### **Bonus Exercises (Optional for Extra Points)**\n\n* **Write a blog post** explaining how to participate in Arbitrum DAO governance and share it on X.\n* **Post about the Governance Bootcamp** on X, sharing thoughts or highlights.\n* **Share insights after each workshop** in a thread, summarizing key takeaways.\n* **Summarize recent governance proposals** in a concise thread to keep the community informed.\n\nThese exercises ensure that trainees develop essential governance skills while actively contributing to Arbitrum DAO’s governance ecosystem.\n\n## **Facilitator Training**\n\nWorkshops will be led by experienced stakeholders from the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem, selected through an application process managed by the Onboarding Working Group. Interested facilitators can apply by selecting up to two workshops they are willing to lead. Those chosen will complete a Facilitator Workshop to ensure they are equipped to run engaging and effective sessions.\n\n### **Facilitator Workshop Overview**\n\nThe Facilitator Workshop prepares participants to deliver high-quality governance training through the following key areas:\n\n**1.Understanding the Role of a Facilitator**\n\n* The importance of learner-centered education in governance.\n* Setting clear expectations for a successful workshop.\n\n**2.Designing an Engaging Learning Experience**\n\n* Structuring content for clarity and impact:\n  * **Introduction** – Setting the context and objectives.\n  * **Core Content** – Balancing explanations, discussions, and examples.\n  * **Conclusion** – Summarizing key takeaways and next steps.\n* Simplifying complex governance topics.\n\n**3.Handling Questions & Discussions**\n\n* Managing difficult or uninformed questions professionally.\n* Encouraging debate and critical thinking.\n* Balancing discussion time while maintaining focus.\n\nTo further support facilitators, the Onboarding Working Group  will provide comprehensive resources and materials to assist with presentation design.\n\n\n\n## MSS\n\nWe will be using the MSS services for payment. For swapping ARB to USDC, the MSS will send funds to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled address.&#x20;\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nBig thank you to the following individuals who helped shape this

Onboarding Program for 7 months.\n\nEarlier this year, the Onboarding Working Group ran a three-month Pilot Program (V1) to bring new participants into the DAO. Based on feedback from delegates and ecosystem participants, we’ve applied key lessons learned to create V2—a more robust and refined iteration of the program.\nV2 will function like a Governance Bootcamp and the Onboarding Working Group will act akin to a recruitment agency, sourcing and training a select group of new DAO contributors.\nThe Onboarding Working Group is comprised of the following individuals: @Manugotsuka from @SEEDGov, @ocandocrypto from @web3citizenxyz, @san from Reserve Protocol, and @RikaGoldberg from @404DAO. Our advisors are @krst and @Sinkas from L2Beat.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO needs to onboard high-quality and diverse (**see note 1**) governance participants to thrive in the future. Currently, fragmented information, siloed resources, and private communication channels create a culture of exclusivity, making it challenging for newcomers to navigate the governance process and contribute meaningfully.\n\nIn V1, we pioneered a solution by running a Pilot Program where we hosted weekly onboarding calls and grouped participants into one of five Fellowship tracks based on their interests and skills. Ultimately, each Fellowship was expected to collaborate and work on a Proposal to publish on the forum.\n\nBased on the lessons learned in V1 (details are [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/onboarding-pilot-program-final-report-milestone-3/26046)), we have developed V2, a more robust and meritocratic Onboarding Program. V2 focuses on selecting high-quality participants, training them, and assessing their skills— ultimately matching top performers with Arbitrum Protocols that need a Governance Fellow. (**see note 2**)\n\n**Note 1**: *In an effort to increase diversity within Arbitrum, we are committed to ensuring that at least 25% of program participants are female/non-binary. This ratio is aligned with the representation in the Pilot Program (V1). We will also focus on inclusivity, creating opportunities for LGBTQ+ and applicants from underrepresented regions, including developing countries, throughout the application and interview process.*\n\n**Note 2**: *V2 does not guarantee program participants with long-term placement in the DAO.*\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Governance Analyst** — An individual who is selected into V2 based on their application and interview.\n\n**Governance Fellow** — A Governance Analyst who successfully graduates from the program and is subsequently matched with a Protocol to assist with Governance work.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Onboarding Program consists of the following components:\n\n* An Application and Interview Process.\n* A Curated Curriculum and Workshops.\n* Exercises to assess comprehension of workshop materials.\n* A Rubric to evaluate and grade exercises.\n* Completion NFTs/Forum Badge for Governance Analysts and Fellows\n* An updated DAO Contributors List\n\nThese components are described in detail below.\n\n## Applications and Interview Process\n\nTo assess candidates for experience and cultural fit, V2 will include a one-month rolling application period followed by a month of interviews, after which twenty applicants will be selected to join the program.\n\nWe will be seeking applicants with specific characteristics, including a positive mindset, an ability to work well with others, an aptitude to engage in healthy debate, and an eagerness to learn. Furthermore, applicants should have a high-level of familiarity with Ethereum and L2s.\n\n## Workshops\n\nOver the course of 6 weeks, the selected cohort of 20 Governance Analysts will participate in weekly workshops that cover critical concepts (see Curriculum section) of Arbitrum DAO’s governance process.\n\nThe workshops will be primarily facilitated by Manugotsuka (Manu), a Governance Contributor at @SeedGov, who is most notably involved in managing Arbitrum’s Delegate Incentive Program. Members of the SEEDGov team will also support Manu as needed.\n\n## Curriculum\n\nThe following governance content will be covered in the workshops:\n**Note: You can find links to all content in the original** [**forum**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-onboarding-v2-a-governance-bootcamp/27546) **post.**\n\n### Arbitrum Protocol Basics:\n\n* A gentle introduction to Arbitrum\n* Get started with Arbitrum\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Governance Basics\n\n* The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO\n* How to Delegate your Voting Power\n* How to Submit a DAO Proposal and Docs\n* Writing Your First Proposal to the ArbitrumDAO\n* Proposal Lifecycle (RFC, Snapshot, Tally)\n* Constitutional vs. Non Constitutional Proposals\n\n### An Introduction to the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n* The role of the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Proposals\n\n* Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations\n* COI & Self Voting Policies\n* Incentives Detox Proposal\n* Code of Conduct\n* Mission, Vision, Purpose\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Initiatives\n\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Working Groups, Committees, Councils and Service Providers\n* Security Council\n* Key Delegates\n  -Multisig Support Services (Entropy)\n* Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\n* Stylus Sprint\n* Grants Programs: (Foundation, Questbook)\n* Additional Grants resources: GrantsDAO\n\n### Arbitrum Tech Deep Dive\n\n* How to create a Dapps on Arbitrum\n* Orbit Chains Technical Introduction\n* A gentle introduction: Stylus\n* Quickstart: Arbitrum bridge\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Tools and Resources\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n* Arbitrum Hub\n* Arbitrum DAO Twitter\n* Arbitrum DAO Updates\n* Governance Forum\n* Arbitrum DAO Calendar\n* Foundation-led: Bi-weekly Proposal Discussions Call\n* Monthly Governance Reporting Call\n* Telegram Updates Channel\n* Weekly Voting Reminders\n* Snapshot\n* Tally\n\n*Note: Recordings will be shared on X to maximize the educational content’s distribution and reach.*\n\nA week-over-week schedule is presented in the below table:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafkreif3e3yjzza3btoh3yxsnei7atvve2yljb6fx443kbg7ienscfid34)\n\n## Exercises\n\nAt the conclusion of the 6 weeks of workshops, participants will have two weeks to work on practical exercises to apply the knowledge they gained.\n\nThese exercises, along with the grading rubric, will be designed by Sandra Carillo (a V1 Pilot Program Fellow, Project Manager at Reserve Protocol, and Developer).\n\nThe top 10 submissions will be eligible to be matched with an Arbitrum Protocol where they will acquire real-world governance experience as Governance Fellows (more details in the ‘Governance Fellows’ section).\n\nThose not selected for matching will be invited to participate in the next cohort on a “fast-track,” bypassing the application and interview process. This creates a positive feedback loop, providing multiple opportunities for individuals to be matched with a Protocol and contribute to Arbitrum governance.\n\nThe next section provides Sample Exercises.\n\n### Mandatory:\n\n1. Draft a mock proposal for Arbitrum DAO and submit it for feedback on the Governance Forum – This encourages participants to actively engage with the governance process, understand proposal creation, and contribute thoughtful feedback. This is an exercise that can be made in groups of 3 or 4 people.\n2. Comment on at least three different Governance Forum proposals, providing thoughtful feedback or questions – This ensures participants are involved in governance discussions and contributing to decision-making.\n3. Write a blog post explaining how to participate in governance for Arbitrum DAO and share it on X or Farcaster– This promotes deeper understanding of the DAO structure and helps educate the broader community.\n4. Attend an Open Discussion of Proposal(s) call and write a thread about your experience on X or Farcaster – Participation in live discussions helps foster community engagement and ensures participants are informed about ongoing governance. As the Open Discussion of Proposal(s) happens every 2 weeks, the participants will have the opportunity to attend to at least 1 call.\n5. Share on the governance forum how you would vote on a proposal that’s currently in active voting, explaining your rationale and feedback – This promotes critical thinking and encourages participants to articulate their rationale on voting process.\n\n### Bonus Points\n\n1. Write a tweet or a cast about the Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Program on X or Farcaster: Share your thoughts or highlights from the onboarding experience, spreading the word about how others can get involved.\n2. Share your insights after each workshop in an X or Farcaster thread: Reflect on key takeaways and learnings from the workshops, helping others benefit from your knowledge and fostering community discussion.\n3. Write a thread summarizing recent governance proposals and share it on X or Farcaster: Provide a clear, concise overview of the latest proposals to keep the community informed and encourage broader participation.\n4. Write a tweet thread explaining how ARB token holders can participate in governance and share it on X or Farcaster: Educate the broader community by breaking down how ARB holders can engage in governance, making the process more accessible and encouraging more involvement.\n\n*Note: These exercises will be refined before V2 starts.*\n\n## Rubric\n\nThe rubric that we will use to grade Exercise submissions is provided in the below table. We drew inspiration from the Rubric created by SeedGov for the Delegate Incentive Program.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafybeifjdau4h2r25gg74fqljlajldtt7slpgjtrnrq6vuzbghqnmwsv4u)\n\n*Maximum points per exercise: 25 points*\n*Maximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises: 125 points*\n*Maximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises and 2 bonus exercises: 175 points*\n\n## Governance Analysts and Fellows\n\nThe highest-scoring Governance Analysts (up to 10 individuals), based on rubric evaluations, will graduate to become Governance Fellows and will be matched with a protocol to assist with governance work.\n\nEach Fellow will be paid a monthly stipend of $1,500 USD in ARB. The Onboarding Working Groups will support Fellows during these two-months to ensure maximum alignment and success.\n\nOcandocrypto (Angela), a Contributor at Web3Citizen and an Arbitrum DAO Delegate, will manage the relationships between Protocols, Governance Fellows, and the Onboarding Program.\n\nIf your protocol is interested in working with a Governance Fellow, please indicate that in your comment on this forum post or reach out directly to Angela @ocandocrypto on Telegram.\n\n## KPIs\n\nWe will be measuring the Onboarding program’s success with quantitative KPIs. To ensure alignment and leverage existing DAO programs, we will base these KPIs on the metrics tracked in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP v1.5).\n\nSpecifically, we will be using the following metrics (please refer to the Karma delegate dashboard):\n\n* Snapshot Voting (SV)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Tally Voting (TV)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Commenting Rationale\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Delegates Feedback (DF)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in DF from beginning to end of program*\n\nWe will use a 6-month trailing average will be used to calculate the program’s starting baseline for each metric, smoothing out monthly variability in the number of proposals. For the program’s endpoint, we will use a 3-month trailing average, aligned with the 3-month duration of the Fellowship.\n\nTo ensure realistic expectations for Fellows, we will use a 5% increase as a baseline goal for each metric.\n\n## KYC\n\nGovernance Fellows will need to KYC with the Foundation in order to receive the stipend. We will work with the Foundation on this process.\n\n## MSS\n\nWe plan to use the MSS services for payment.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe have intentionally allocated ample time, 2 weeks, for delegates to respond and provide feedback on the forum. We will incorporate the feedback and make necessary revisions before posting to Snapshot.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nRFC Discussion: *November 18 - Dec 2*\nSnapshot: *Dec 5 - Dec 12*\nTally: *January 6 - January 27*\nWe are planning to start the Program on February 10, 2025 and end on September 29, 2025.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe are proposing a budget of $193,138 USD (including a 30% volatility buffer and accounting for an ARB price of $0.69) paid in ARB over 7 months. Any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO.\n\nA detailed budget breakdown can be found here: [Arbitrum Onboarding WG Budget V1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNFl_Uko0tY5kiG1F4eoLbYeA7EU5W5RDb_RBKTJ9ec/edit?gid=1283170482#gid=1283170482).\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafkreidqkbhiyes56ltf3v6ggmrdzd7pddqbxypdd66mwwix6b23gtqmeu)",

    "description": "# [NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Arbitrum Audit Program\n# Arbitrum Audit Program\n\nSummary:\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to run an on-going open application for 1 year to support projects that require a subsidy to audit their project.\n* A list of auditors will be approved into the program, and auditing firms are also invited from the ADPC’s Security Subsidy Fund to apply for the program.\n* Arbitrum Audit Committee will include membership of Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, a technical expert elected by the DAO, and a team member from the OpCo (when operational).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIt is industry standard and recommended practice that all projects with on-chain smart contracts undergo at least one third party audit. This is because smart contracts can potentially secure millions, if not billions of dollars, yet a single bug in the code can result in the loss of all funds. In many cases, when the smart contract is deployed, it can be difficult to upgrade after launch, and audits should be completed prior to the project going live.\n\nUnfortunately, audits are prohibitively expensive. It is not uncommon for projects to pay ~$20k per auditor per week. If multiple auditors are required for the project, then the bill increases substantially into six figures. This is problematic for early stage projects who may simply lack the funds to pay for an audit or be forced to allocate a significant portion of the funds they have raised from investors to pay for the audit.\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a subsidy scheme that will allocate funds to projects that require financial assistance to pay for an audit. To be eligible for the funds, the project will need to satisfy certain requirements such as launching on Arbitrum and any code audited will need to remain exclusive to our ecosystem for a fixed period of time.\n\nWe are targeting relatively early stage projects, projects that have demonstrated product market fit on Arbitrum, and finally projects that have remained loyal to our ecosystem with an upcoming launch or upgrade that has the potential to help grow the ecosystem.\n\nThe subsidy program will run for 1 year or until all funds are spent. An appointed Arbitrum Audit committee will run the program. There will be 4 (quarterly) transparency reports alongside a final summary report to keep the DAO abreast about program updates.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. **Support early-stage projects.** Promising projects face funding constraints that may prevent their launch without access to a third party audit or for them to somewhat dangerously ‘test in production.’\n2. **Encourage development on Arbitrum.** By supporting builders and early-stage projects, we can potentially help make Arbitrum their home over other blockchains.\n3. **Scaling Responsibly.** Scalability is not just about transaction throughput, but the ability for the system as a whole to secure and protect an increasing number of tokens (TVL).\n4. **On-demand availability**. An open applications process to offer subsidy grants to projects just in time before their planned launch.\n\n## Application Process\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"79\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4dba90dfcb10fad5cb7debac34b9ec6f83e03ab5_2_624x79.png\" />1600×203 26.7 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4dba90dfcb10fad5cb7debac34b9ec6f83e03ab5.png)\n\n\n\nThe Arbitrum Audit Subsidy Program invites projects to apply via an open applications track with a standardised form to gather the following information:\n\n* **Team Information**\n  * Names\n  * Background\n  * Notable Investors\n* **Project Information**\n  * Overview & problem it is solving\n  * Why will project achieve product market fit (or evidence of PMF, like traction or other metrics)\n  * Stage of development & timeline to mainnet\n* **Audit coverage**\n  * Scope of audit\n  * Lines of code & languages\n  * Desired completion date\n  * \\[extra information here]\n* **Subsidy information**\n  * Preferred auditor \\[optional]\n  * Audit budget request\n\nThe committee will screen the above information based on:\n\n* **Technical maturity:** Assess whether the code base is ready for a professional audit.\n* **Team experience:** Evaluate whether the team has the experience, expertise, and motivation to successfully launch the project on mainnet.\n* **Likelihood of success:** Judge whether the project has the potential to attract a user base and establish itself as a popular decentralized application on Arbitrum.\n* **Reasonable scope:** Determine if the audit’s scope can be completed within the proposed timeline and budget.\n* **Arbitrum first.** The project will prioritise launching on Arbitrum including One, Nova, and other Arbitrum chains.\n\nA project can be rejected at any stage of the process at the committee’s discretion.\n\nIf the committee approves the project during the screening process, then it will undertake due diligence which may include reference checks, reviewing the code related to the audit scope, and other information it may deem necessary to check. Assuming the due diligence succeeds, then the committee will aid the project in connecting with auditors to get the best quote alongside confirming the auditor has the capability to audit the project.\n\nIt is up to the project to decide on the auditor, but it must be in agreement with the Arbitrum Audit committee. We expect auditors to be selected based on the rate charged to the project (i.e., auditor per week cost), availability and timeline for completing the audit and experience with auditing similar projects. In the case of an auditing competition platform, the auditor will need to demonstrate that the auditors on their platform have the required skillset for the specific project.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a subsidy program, which will require the project to pay a portion of the audit, which will also be negotiated as part of the application process.\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nWe welcome applications from early stage and existing projects that satisfy the following requirements:\n\n* **Smart contracts.** Projects must have auditable smart contract code to qualify. We only subsidize audits for smart contracts and not the wider infrastructure. For example, Solidity or Stylus.\n* **Early stage project.** Projects yet to launch their product are eligible or there is a significant upgrade for the code. They are allowed to have received venture capital or grants. Total funds raised will be considered as part of the decision making process by the committee.\n* **Native deployment.** Projects that are operational on Arbitrum must demonstrate either a strong product market fit or a committed alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem with expectations that subsequent product launches will be successful.\n* **Migrating deployment.** Project is planning to migrate from another blockchain ecosystem to Arbitrum\n* **New audits only.** Only new code, or code that has undergone significant modifications.\n* **Arbitrum exclusivity.** Audited code must remain exclusive to Arbitrum for a fixed period of time.\n* **Arbitrum ecosystem.** The project must launch in the Arbitrum ecosystem which includes all Arbitrum chains (including Arbitrum One or launching their own chain).\n\nWith the above in mind, our aim is to target early stage projects with potential to grow on Arbitrum as well as projects with a strong track record or loyalty to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAll audited code MUST remain exclusive to the Arbitrum ecosystem and this will be included in the relevant legal agreements. Breaching exclusivity will obligate the project to repay the full subsidy to the DAO via the Arbitrum Foundation (AF). Non-compliance may lead to legal recourse and/or a proposal to the DAO to ban the project from all future DAO-funded initiatives.\n\n## Subsidy Payment Conditions\n\nSubsidy payments will only be paid after the audit is completed. The Arbitrum Foundation will disburse the funds to the auditor. All payments are contingent upon the Foundation’s satisfaction that the audit meets acceptable quality and confirms to industry standards.\n\nAdditionally, we will seek when possible to offer the payment in ARB as opposed to USD, subject to the auditor’s needs.\n\n## Approving Auditors\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will take on the role of evaluating auditors who want to apply for this program which includes an interview, reference checks, compliance, and agreement to the terms & conditions of this program. It should be noted that we will conduct an individual negotiation with all approved auditors to take into account potential different rates and offerings from the auditors. Additionally, auditors can apply at any time to join the program.\n\nAn approved auditor will have an opportunity to post on the forum to advertise that they have been accepted to the program. This will assist projects with finding auditors that may be suitable for them even if a subsidy is not offered by this program.\n\nAdditionally, we will invite auditing firms from the ADPC’s Security Subsidy Fund to apply, with the intention for us to negotiate additional terms that are suitable for this new program.\n\n## Arbitrum Audit Committee\n\nWe propose a committee with a mixture of technical expertise and DAO representation who will have the necessary skills and time to review proposals on an on-going basis.\n\n1. Chair: Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n2. Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n3. Technical Expert - Elected by DAO\n4. Arbitrum DAO’s OpCo (when operational)\n\nWe have included the OpCo as a potential team member as soon as it is operational and considers itself ready to join. The AF will chair the committee to lead the discussion and decision making process with consultation of other committee members.\n\nThe committee will enforce a strict conflict of interest policy such that no member should have any financial ties to an approved auditing firm that is taking part in the program and they should not have a significant conflict of interest with competing blockchain projects. The technical expert should not be part of the auditing firms engaged in the program and will be paid USD$5k per month. We expect the workload to be ~1-2 days per week.\n\nScope of work includes:\n\n* Attend committee meetings to evaluate proposals,\n* Support some due diligence efforts on projects,\n* Lend expertise to make good decisions,\n* Help with transparency & reporting.\n\n## Transparency Report\n\nThe committee will publish an update in regards to the program every 3 months with a total of 4 reports. Additionally, a final ‘conclusion report’ will be published, after the final audit subsidy is paid.\n\nAll reports will include the following information:\n\n* Categories of projects in the pipeline (DeFi, Gaming, SocialFi, etc),\n* Total projects rejected, under review and accepted,\n* Completed audits alongside disclosure on project and selected auditor,\n* Treasury of ARB and USD alongside funds spent to date,\n* Success stories.\n\nAs mentioned during the governance calls, we do not plan to release specific financial details related to individual subsidy payment. The ADPC acknowledged that auditors are sensitive to revealing their rates to competitors. Additionally, this information is often leveraged by potential grantees during the negotiation process which would make the committee’s job more difficult.\n\nWe may also have a delay in reporting the ‘funds spent to date’ depending on the total grants issued to help preserve some privacy around individual subsidies paid. We hope to include success stories, but this will be in later reports as it will take time for audits to be completed, protocols to launch, and for success stories to emerge.\n\nAdditionally, all grantees of the program will be requested to publish a growth report to the DAO, 2, 4 and 6 months after their project is launched on Arbitrum. In this report, we expect the grantee to publish metrics relevant to their project, including but not limited to, total value locked (TVL), protocol fees generated, integration with other protocols in Arbitrum, utilization of assets, etc. The committee will work with the grantee to determine the relevant metrics and deadlines for publishing the report. The Arbitrum Foundation will keep track of the reports after the program has finished to ensure they are all published to the DAO.\n\n## Budget Request\n\nIt is not uncommon for projects to pay $10k to $40k per auditor per week depending on the complexity of the project with overall costs exceeding $100k.\n\nIf we assume, conservatively, that each project will receive a $100k subsidy, then with a $10M budget, we can subsidize around 100 projects to build on Arbitrum which is approximately 1.9 projects per week for 1 year.\n\nWe are requesting a $10M USD budget to subsidise audits for 1 year and $60K to pay for the technical expert. All other costs including legal, management of the program, etc, will be covered by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nOur proposal will:\n\n* Request 30m ARB from the treasury,\n* Convert ARB into $10m and $60k (compensation),\n* Return all unused ARB and USDC back to the DAO.\n\nWhenever the program ends, the remaining funds in USDC and ARB, will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO unless the DAO approves the continuation of the program via an off-chain vote.\n\nWe intend to convert ARB to USD periodically throughout the duration of the auditing program as opposed to exchanging it all at once.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe consider the establishment of a long-term security subsidy fund as an urgent matter to support builders in Arbitrum and will work with contributors in the Arbitrum DAO to get the program set up as soon as possible.\n\nWe have run three governance calls with two recorded \\[[1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qY81BLCjMTNeXvOrtAt2dxDyoKCFCuFq/view),[2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnBbdk02VTDLFfDy-MMzmgm3rGx6fzrP/view)] and the temperature check vote has [passed on Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xebbcad364ae7f02797b9cd7f30c668907d479d4bb5ba7f5d775849822297a01d).\n\nWe are appreciative of all the helpful comments and discussions we have had with contributors in the DAO. We believe the proposal should hopefully satisfy most comments that have been raised over the past few weeks and the proposal is overall better thanks to the process.\n\nAssuming the proposal is approved by the Arbitrum DAO, then we will:\n\n* Hold an election to hire the technical expert that should be concluded by 10th April 2025.\n* Onboard auditors and open applications for projects by late April 2025.\n\nAn official announcement will be published to declare the start date and when the 1 year clock for the program begins.",

    "description": "# The Watchdog: Arbitrum DAO’s Grant Misuse Bounty Program\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has [allocated](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals) several hundred million dollars across various initiatives, including incentive programs, grants, investment vehicles, and service providers. While these allocations have driven growth and innovation, there has been minimal oversight or review of how these funds are ultimately used, and no system currently exists to incentivize the identification and reporting of fund misappropriation. Although three instances of misuse have been uncovered, it is likely that additional cases remain undetected.\n\nIn response, Entropy Advisors proposes the establishment of a **grant misuse bounty program dubbed “The Watchdog”** to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The program would utilize an incentive mechanism to reward community contributors and investigators who submit verifiable reports of misappropriation.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBy offering financial rewards for valid reports of misappropriation, there will be a stronger motivation for community members to contribute skills or information that aid in identifying misconduct in the DAO. Today, the identification of wrongdoing can result in retaliation, unnecessary friction within the DAO, and other negative externalities for the investigators.\n\nMoreover, with no incentive to bring forth allegations, it is unlikely that most community members would do so. The Watchdog program creates a decentralized force of accountability, augmenting the DAO’s capacity to detect abuse that would likely otherwise go unnoticed while protecting the submitter from repercussions.\n\nArbitrum DAO’s successful identification of misappropriated funds, whether by a service provider, protocol, grant recipient, or anyone else that receives funds from Arbitrum DAO has three main benefits:\n\n1. The DAO (mainly through the Foundation, as it has done so in the past) may be able to recapture some of the funds. This could involve legal avenues, smart contract enforcement (clawbacks / stream stopping), or community pressure through the use of the DAO’s blacklisting abilities.\n2. The evidence can be used to identify possible improvement opportunities in the underlying programs and make more informed decisions surrounding the recognized bad actors in the future.\n3. A mechanism for malicious action deterrence and attracts sophisticated onchain sleuths to Arbitrum.\n\nJust the existence of a transparent and well-publicized bounty program will likely deter some malicious actors from misusing DAO funds in the first place. Knowing that the community has the tools and incentives to identify misallocation increases the risk of exposure for those who might consider abusing the DAO’s trust. Recipients of DAO funds will need to think twice before acting maliciously or in a way that doesn’t align with the DAO’s strategic objectives, rules, and the broader interests of Arbitrum.\n\nBy allowing anyone to submit evidence-based reports of misuse anonymously, the program empowers the entire Arbitrum and crypto ecosystem to take an active role in maintaining the financial health and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. We hope this fosters a culture of vigilance, good intentions, and accountability while bringing white-hat actors into the ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Watchdog program will extend to ALL DAO-funded initiatives including end recipients of other programs such as the Questbook Domain program, Stylus Sprint, Arbitrum Foundation grants, and the incentives programs. The process for rewarding those who successfully identify fund misuse will start with a temporary solution utilizing a small committee of reviewers with a long-term plan for the program to eventually fall under OpCo.\n\nEntropy proposes the following definition of misuse of funds:\n\n*Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.*\n\nMisuse definitions and examples below are included solely as a point of reference for the DAO and all decisions surrounding severity will be at the full discretion of the committee:\n\n* **Low:** Cases where there is minor misuse of DAO-allocated funds with limited impact on the DAO’s overall financial health, reputation, or strategic goals.\n  * Example: A Questbook domain allocator accidentally sent a double payment for a milestone and the recipient did not report it.\n  * Example: A grant recipient uses a portion of the funds for unauthorized purposes, such as non-DAO-aligned marketing, travel, or administrative overhead not included in the grant proposal.\n* **Medium:** Cases involving significant misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impact the DAO’s resources or strategic goals, but where the misuse is still recoverable, or partial results have been delivered.\n  * Example: An incentive program recipient uses funds in a way that does not benefit end users, but is a step away from outright theft and fraud.\n  * Example: A grant recipient diverts a significant portion of the funds (e.g., 50k+ ARB) to unrelated projects or personal use.\n* **High:** Cases involving large-scale, deliberate misuse of DAO-allocated funds.\n  * Example: A fund-recipient fabricates deliverables to obtain funds without working on the approved project, then disappears with the entire grant.\n  * Example 2: Theft or unauthorized transfers, such as if MSS members purposefully diverted funds to a recipient not eligible.\n\nThe workflow for Watchdog reports will be as follows:\n\n**1. Report Submission**\n\n* Anyone (watchers) can identify potential misuse of funds that originated from the DAO and submit an evidence-based report to a designated section on a to-be-created GlobaLeaks portal (explained further below).. Throughout the entire process, the identity of the submitter will remain private. As detailed further in step 3, the report will only be made public to the DAO in the instance that attempts at backchannel communications with the alleged party fail and a DAO ban is constituted or on a case-by-case basis where the committee deems it prudent to make the DAO aware of the misuse.\n* Reports will follow a standard template to help streamline the review process and collect the initial necessary information.\n\n**2. Review Process**\n\n* A whitelisted group of three DAO-associated reviewers will have the ability to review the submitted reports. The initial reviewers will comprise the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and SeedGov. This structure minimizes the operating costs of the program until OpCo is stood up. Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation will be waiving payment as reviewers. SeedGov will be compensated at a rate of $40 an hour for the time their team puts towards reviewing Watchdog reports each month. The payment will be paid out in ARB with the amount being determined based on the price of ARB at the time of payment. This rate is comparable to the rate SeedGov is receiving as the DIP administrator. We anticipate the review process for a Watchdog report to take a minimal amount of hours, so the ARB used to pay SeedGov will come from the requested 400K ARB budget.\n* The three reviewers will discuss reports and, if required, contact the concerned party for clarifications. If two or more reviewers agree (at their discretion) that the submission is based on substance and misuse has occurred, the watcher(s) will receive the bounty. The reviewers will also determine the level of severity of the misuse (Low, Medium, High), which will impact the bounty reward as outlined in step 4.\n* In the case that 2 or more reviewers deem there has been fund misuse, and recovery is deemed feasible, the Arbitrum Foundation will open up private channels of communication with the concerned party and attempt to get the funds back for the DAO.\n* Reviewers are required to abstain from specific review processes if a conflict of interest (COI) is identified. If two or more reviewers have an identified COI, the reviewers will identify two external parties who don’t have COIs and have the capabilities to review the report. If the report is made public, the reviewers’ identified COIs will be published at the same time. To reduce the need for an additional election process and budgeted compensation, the Watchdog program will leverage trusted community members who have been elected to other Arbitrum DAO initiatives such as, but not limited to, the Domain Allocators from the D.A.O. program, MSS members, or ARDC V2 members.\n\n**3. DAO Forum & Snapshot Voting**\n\n* On a case by case basis, if all attempts at backchanneling fail and the accused party is nonresponsive, the report may be posted to the forum with all the watcher’s personal and identifiable information redacted in the version posted publicly. Additionally, on a case by case basis, the committee may decide to post a summary of a grant misuse report to inform the DAO of certain incidents. Otherwise individual reports will not be posted to the forum directly. It is Entropy’s belief that in instances of low misuse, it is unwise to subject teams to public scrutiny for what could be a common or minor error.\n* If deemed necessary through the recommendation of the review committee, the DAO can vote via Snapshot on whether or not the violation constitutes a DAO ban. Delegates can reference the [Furucombo instance](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x07bea6e32d32b4d3ed20faec6950c3546e2319bc2497716c53ee05995d4a00eb) as an example.\n* In every case, the Arbitrum Foundation will determine if legal recourse is viable. This will be dependent on the size of funds involved in the misuse and legal jurisdiction of the accused party.\n\n**4. Reward Mechanism**\n\n* If the review committee deems a report valid at their discretion, they will determine what level of misuse. A certain level of subjectivity has been introduced due to the wide range of programs that the Watchdog program will cover. A mix of factors will be taken into account the level of severity. These include, but are not limited to the total amount of funds involved, how the funds were used (ex. simple error or intentional fraud), if the misuse is rectifiable, and/or the level of damage to the Arbitrum ecosystem/brand.\n* A fixed reward has been included to ensure that an incentive always exists for community members and individuals to submit reports. The base payouts denominated in ARB will come from the approved Watchdog budget. If funds are able to be recovered, the watcher that submitted the report will receive 5% of the funds, capped with a USD amount depending on the severity. The base ARB payout will be deducted from the overall amount. Base payouts and reward caps are as follows:\n  * **Low:** 1k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $10k.\n  * **Medium:** 10k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $25k.\n  * **High:** 30k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $100k.\n* If recaptured funds are denominated in a volatile asset, the maximum reward awarded to the watcher will be calculated as the 30D TWAP of the underlying asset on the day the transfer is made. The reward will be paid out in the recovered asset. If the recovered asset is ARB, it will be used to replenish the Watchdog’s available budget up to 400k ARB. Any excess ARB or other assets recovered will be returned to the DAO’s treasury or the Arbitrum Foundation depending on the source of the original grant.\n* The reviewing committee composed of Entropy Advisors, the Arbitrum Foundation, and SeedGov reserve the right to adjust the base payout and reward structure. This flexibility will allow for adjustments to be made in the event of major changes to market conditions or evidence that the proposed structure is not adequately incentivizing watchers.\n* While anyone is encouraged to submit reports, only watchers that complete a KYC with the Foundation will be eligible for rewards.\n\nWe believe that this mechanism is optimal for the time being, but once OpCo is stood up, it is our recommendation that the program be moved into its domain. If done so, the reviewing mechanism will likely be restructured.\n\nThe program will run until the 400K ARB is exhausted from valid misuse reports. If the budget falls below 100k ARB before the program is moved to OpCo, Entropy Advisors will notify the DAO and potentially put forward a proposal to extend the budget.\n\nBefore moving the program under the domain of OpCo or 6 months post program launch, whichever occurs first, Entropy Advisors will provide a retrospective report to help evaluate the successfulness of the Watchdog. The report will summarize the received misuse cases along with data such as total amount of misuse, severity breakdowns, and amount of ARB recovered.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAfter the Watchdog program passed on Snapshot, Entropy began contacting potential providers in order to solicit bids for a dedicated portal. As shared in Entropy’s February [monthly update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-monthly-update-february-2025/28646), following discussions with [@JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo) and the Arbitrum Foundation, it was determined that introducing a separate portal introduced unnecessary fragmentation and Entropy believed there was an opportunity to combine the creation of the Watchdog site with a larger Arbitrum branded grants portal, an idea expressed originally in our [voting rationale](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-rfc-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program-season-3/27584/130) for Season 3 of the D.A.O program. Through the end of February and most of March, Entropy explored this idea with several different providers and development teams.\n\nDuring these discussions, it became clear that such a portal would be a several month endeavor, so to not delay the Watchdog program any further, Entropy explored a few open source whistleblower software solutions and concluded that [GlobaLeaks](https://www.globaleaks.org/) is the best option for a temporary grant misuse portal.\n\nFor those not familiar with GlobaLeaks, it is an open-source whistleblowing platform used by governments, NGOs, and investigative journalists. A dedicated submission portal can be deployed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a VPS to enable secure & anonymous submissions. For the Watchdog program, it is a free option that supports the submission and review of grant misuse reports, offers end-to-end encryption, includes a reviewer dashboards, and has optional Tor access for sleuths looking to maximize their privacy.\n\nFor the time being, we believe a GlobaLeaks portal is a sufficient temporary option for the Watchdog and can be simply linked on the Foundation’s grant page. If the program is successful and the larger Arbitrum grants portal comes to fruition, the Watchdog program can easily be transferred over.\n\n## Budget\n\n400,000 ARB will be sent to a new Arbitrum Foundation controlled [address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9Cfcf93dC53dF1C7986eB5ec3CF07A234d94b635). These funds will be used to reward valid Watchdog reports and pay SeedGov.\n\n## Updated Timeline\n\nMay 8th - 22nd: Onchain Vote\n\nEnd of May: Program is launched",

    "description": "# DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)\n# DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)\n\n## Non-constitutional\n\n### Change made on 6/02/25\n\nThe following language was added to the proposal:\n*“The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

    "description": "# Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working with the Arbitrum DAO, Y2-Y3\n## Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nEntropy Advisors was started by Matt Fiebach and Sam Martin with the vision of turning DAOs into sustainable and efficient organizations, and was bootstrapped via an Arbitrum Foundation grant. As the first two employees at Blockworks Research, we felt the vision of what DAOs could deliver versus what they actually resembled in reality warranted more dedicated attention from a team passionate about the potential impact DAOs could have on an ecosystem. It has now been 14 months since Entropy Advisors was incorporated, and while we have accomplished a lot, there is a vast amount of work that remains.\n\nAs this term comes to a close on August 31st, we want to take the opportunity to say thank you to those in the Arbitrum community who have supported our team and given us a path to make an impact on such a large stage by funding us through our first DAO [proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22562217031893796518849144396978331510254494883851105730012486117405397295942). Without the Arbitrum DAO, Entropy Advisors would not have been possible.\n\nThis proposal is to extend our partnership with the DAO for two additional years. If passed, our second official engagement would go into effect on September 1, 2025, immediately following the conclusion of our first mandate. Entropy Advisors’ exclusive focus over the next two years is transforming Arbitrum into the most effective capital allocating DAO in crypto, leveraging treasury strategy, incentives design, data, and special projects to drive compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\n## Year 1 Retrospective\n\nWe invite everyone to review our initial [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-exclusively-working-with-arbitrum-dao/25246) and reflect on our successes and failures, and to provide candid feedback to our team as we begin the process towards a second term.\n\n> ### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)* Neutral Proposal Broker\n> * Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n> * Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n> * Proposal Incubation\n> * Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO’s best interests in mind.\n> * The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises—we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n> * Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum’s key stakeholders\n> * Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n> * Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n> * Product and Strategy\n> * Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n> * Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n> * Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\n**Full-time Arbitrum DAO:** We grew the team from just Sam and Matt to 8 full-time and 1 intern, and we remain laser-focused on attracting the highest quality talent in the space to commit themselves exclusively to Arbitrum. While we believe that we have formed a very strong team thus far, the composition of our team will always be a top priority to ensure we have the tools at our disposal to serve the ecosystem with high-quality execution. In the coming year, we would like to continue growing as needs arise: more data analytics help, applied researchers, TradFi converts, and those with early-stage experience are at the top of mind, with a goal of scaling beyond 10 members on our team.\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"TeamSlide\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/88e216931be7c9d4d55aff245cc551c383f6cca6_2_690x388.jpeg\" />TeamSlide3200×1800 824 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/88e216931be7c9d4d55aff245cc551c383f6cca6.jpeg \"TeamSlide\")\n\n\n\n**Beyond Proposals:** Over the past year, Entropy has evolved beyond just a proposals shop and become a recognizable, consistent face of the Arbitrum DAO in the broader crypto community. From press to partnerships, conferences to committees, we’ve built a strong reputation for professionalism, reliability, and alignment. Our ability to foster trust across stakeholders from Offchain Labs and the Foundation to top investors, asset managers, and builders has been one of our most important assets, and something we intend to amplify in years 2 and 3. We recognize that this is where we have produced the most value throughout our first year and aim to continue to grow into our strengths. On countless occasions, we have joined Offchain Labs and Arbitrum Foundation’s partnerships teams in helping outline strategy and closing deals. With some blue-chip ecosystem partners, Entropy works as their main point of contact in Arbitrum. We have grown into a trusted tool augmenting existing AAEs.\n\n**Syncing Stakeholders:** We are happy with our output over the past ~year in regards to the first two deliverables we outlined (see above). We hosted three (a fourth is planned for EthCC) “Delegate Days” in Brussels, Bangkok, and Denver over the past year, where we gathered large delegates, members from Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to align on key objectives over the subsequent quarter(s). We also hosted key stakeholder calls with the same groups once per month in an effort to align on high-importance topics that require attention in the near term. Entropy has also been speaking with OCL, the AF, and key delegates and ecosystem contributors every two weeks to streamline communications across the ecosystem. These efforts are quite time-consuming, but have proven to lead to some of our most impactful work over the past year.\n\n**Strategic Proposals:** We successfully passed a plethora of proposals authored internally, as well as assisted third parties in drafting proposals to the DAO or submitting applications to DAO-led programs. Some examples here include Govhack Brussels, the MSS, The Ethereum Attackathon Sponsorship, leading the ARB staking working group and bolstering the quality of contributors to the research (bringing in Vending Machine and ASXN to assist), the Delegate Code of Conduct, establishing an events budget, getting treasury management moving forward after a long stagnation through the v1.2 proposal, leading the STEP II committee, moving forward with the MVP exercise to align stakeholders, our DRIP proposal to reignite incentives/support for builders and users, the Stylus Sprint, assisting Max Lomu with his chain abstraction proposal, etc. We can’t touch on all of them here, but please refer to our forum [profile](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/entropy/summary) for more information.\n\nImportantly, in many cases, we evaluated whether supporting external contributors/committees or internalizing portions of execution made the most sense for the DAO. In some instances, we chose to execute internally, not because we wanted less external contribution, but because we deemed it the most efficient, high-context, and cost-effective way to get things done. Our north star has always been to make DAO execution smoother, more strategic, and resource-efficient. Sometimes that meant helping third parties structure their ideas, but other times it meant owning the process ourselves to ensure tighter execution, lower overhead, and greater accountability.\n\n**OpCo Groundwork:** We also laid the groundwork for a more expedited proposal process by helping mold the new direction for the Arbitrum DAO, which was recently [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962) by the AF, and we also created the [OpCo proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) that should make working with the DAO a much smoother process from the perspective of service providers.\n\nWe expect OpCo to pick up the portion of the aforementioned work that relates to key stakeholder alignment and coordination once it is fully operational. Aligning all the largest stakeholders in the ecosystem in order to allow for more effective operations was a massive undertaking and took a large amount of our bandwidth over the course of our first year. Despite the large investment of time and resources, we believe the groundwork has been laid for a more fruitful future for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Learning from Mistakes:** While we feel as though we did a great job on setting the DAO’s future, more efficient path, we certainly fell short on numerous occasions. For example, there were some instances in which we poorly communicated with certain ecosystem participants during application processes. As members of the GMC, many protocols that have sunk significant resources into the ecosystem felt overlooked and undercommunicated with. Our team has since shifted focus to improving our relationships with Arbitrum builders and to being more mindful in providing feedback to applicants by overcommunicating. We also realize that our scope of work was extremely wide in our first proposal, and our deliverables have evolved quite a lot since our engagement started, which might have led to some confusion in the wider community around what Entropy’s role actually is. Our wins have taught us a lot, but our mistakes even more, and we are committed to making corrections based on our learnings throughout our first year in our second engagement.\n\n> Data and Brand Building* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n> * Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n> * Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n> * Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n> * Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n\n**Arbitrum Analytics:** In terms of data and brand building, we are very happy with our output over our first ~year. Our data team has created the go-to [Dune catalog](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors) for those looking for greater insight into the Arbitrum ecosystem. It is worth noting that our data team did not begin work until around the end of December, so we have accomplished a lot here in very little time. We have had numerous investors not currently involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem reach out in admiration, which we believe will have a positive downstream impact that is not easily quantifiable. We have also seen our charts shared across dozens of large accounts on X, featured in blogs and news articles, and referred to during big moments for the ecosystem, such as the rollout of [Timeboost](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-timeboost). We have created a [DAO financials](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-financials) dashboard to give delegates better insight into how the DAO spends/earns money, a [dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals) that enables delegates to dissect various proposals at a granular level, an [RWA case](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) study, a [DAO treasury](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury) dashboard showing all the assets it owns, and [more](https://dune.com/discover/content/relevant?q=author:entropy_advisors\\&resource-type=dashboards).\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"351\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0557b4e63a43a6937af37c009f506b1c4bd271e3_2_624x351.jpeg\" />1600×900 290 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0557b4e63a43a6937af37c009f506b1c4bd271e3.jpeg)\n\n\n\n**Data as a Growth Support Mechanism:** We also learned that data transparency can serve as a great tool for both increasing our reach across various crypto communities as well as improving relationships on the BD front with builders. This complements the goal stated in the previous section of helping to onboard 3rd parties into the ecosystem. For example, we created the most comprehensive data overview of Ethena, which caught the team’s attention. Members of Entropy then worked with OCL to coordinate a trip to the UK at the end of 2024 to meet the Ethena team as they were deciding which tech stack to deploy Converge on. In April 2025, we saw these efforts pay off with Ethena and Securitize [choosing the Arbitrum stack](https://x.com/convergeonchain/status/1912853619038461967).\n\nWe have ambitions to aid more builders within the Arbitrum ecosystem as a support mechanism, and to continue building resources that serve as both marketing material and a BD tool. Where we fell short on brand relative to our original proposal was podcast content/weekly newsletters. While we view this content as valuable, we simply did not have the bandwidth to prioritize these types of initiatives when considering the high-importance items we needed to facilitate. Additionally, we see room for growth as we expand our content outside of solely Arbitrum core and into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the next 2 years, we will create more dashboards that cover apps and infra that are well-positioned to support the expansion of the Arbitrum tech stack, with the goal of encouraging more partners to consider an Arbitrum deployment/support.\n\n**Recognition by News Outlets:** We regularly post threads on X and LinkedIn that highlight important initiatives that are ongoing in the Arbitrum DAO, but we do know that we need to expand our reach to maximize our impact. Members of the Entropy team have been quoted in The Block, Blockworks, CoinDesk, Unchained, and Yahoo Finance about our work in Arbitrum on numerous occasions. Additionally, we have represented Arbitrum on a few podcasts. at multiple conferences, and even in an official Arbitrum marketing video. Although we have plenty of room to keep improving our public brand, we are happy with the growth in the first year.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"351\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a67086041072675eeed75c3353d5f3baba744181_2_624x351.jpeg\" />1600×900 326 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a67086041072675eeed75c3353d5f3baba744181.jpeg)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgment by Investors:** Large ARB token holders have evidently taken notice of our ability to push forward initiatives, be more critical of each individual spending request, and our focus on ecosystem growth, long-term sustainability, and revenue diversification, which has manifested through our rise in voting power. Our ascension to the top of the [ARB delegates](https://dune.com/queries/4713840/7834608) by voting power is a responsibility we do not take lightly, and is something we are really proud of. In our opinion, this signals to us that we are prioritizing the right things and are in the early stages of helping steward the DAO’s path forward.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Vision for Years 2 and 3\n\nNow that it’s increasingly likely that the DAO’s operational structure will include officially recognized AAEs, the path has been paved for Entropy Advisors to shift our focus more fully toward growth, sustainability, and strategic execution. While the OpCo comes to fruition, Entropy will continue to support operations- and oversight-focused initiatives that require continuity. Topics like administering the ARB Staking Working Group, supporting ARDC v2, leading programs like Watchdog and MSS, and maintaining the Delegate Code of Conduct will likely transition over to OpCo, and we will be here to ensure a smooth handoff. We expect this transition to be ongoing throughout the entirety of 2025, with the operations-related workload easing on Entropy’s end by the beginning of 2026.\n\nEntropy Advisors’ singular focus over the next two years is to help the Arbitrum DAO mature into a disciplined capital allocator. We will spearhead building an organization that drives compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth.\n\nArbitrum is now positioned to act more like a sovereign wealth fund: managing a composable treasury, deploying capital with strategic intent, and aligning incentives to deepen protocol adoption and ecosystem loyalty. Entropy’s work across treasury design and management, incentive architecture, data transparency, and ecosystem relationships will operate in tandem to realize this vision.\n\nThe strategy boils down to:\n\n* Build a high-quality treasury of productive, composable assets (LSTs, T-bills, etc.)\n* Deploy a large share of holdings across DeFi as protocol-owned liquidity to generate yield, support aligned builders, and establish Arbitrum leverage. This function will also help onboard new partners, as the DAO will act as an initial source of demand\n* Layer in structured, app-agnostic incentives (DRIP) to attract usage and reinforce protocol alignment\n* Use analytics and reporting to increase visibility, optimize decision-making, and build external trust\n* Leverage relationships and special projects to scale adoption, reinforce values, and extend reach\n\nIn short, we stop throwing darts at the wall and start **designing growth**: capital-efficient, data-informed, and strategically aligned.\n\nOur high-level objectives to achieve the above strategy are as follows, with more details in each deliverable section below:\n\n* Smooth handover to OpCo of DAO operations- and communications-related tasks, while filling the gaps in the interim as needed.\n* Maximize the number of dapps and RWAs that “call Arbitrum Home” by designing treasury management and incentive programs that support BD efforts. Bolster this through data analytics support as a white glove services offering.\n* Formalize the DAO’s financial processes, optimize and introduce revenue streams, ensure AEP licensing fees are paid and idle non-native assets are put to work in DeFi in accordance with portfolio management policies, and continually monitor key protocol revenue drivers like Timeboost and the transaction fee mechanism.\n* Professionalize and iterate on various areas within the Arbitrum DAO, such as the early-stage support funnel or data transparency, by altering their structures and implementing custom front ends.\n\n**Ultimately, our primary goal through 2027 is to make Arbitrum the leading tech stack for builders, institutions, innovators, and users alike; powered by a sustainable flywheel of compounding growth leading to value generation.**\n\n### Financial Planning, Analysis, and Guiding Capital Deployment\n\nEntropy will work closely with AAEs, vendors, and ecosystem teams to build out the DAO’s core financial infrastructure. We believe that the long-term viability of the Arbitrum DAO hinges on prudent asset management, disciplined budgeting, and strategic cash flow deployment to generate additional income, compound growth, and deepen our ecosystem’s liquidity while supporting integral builders. It’s worth emphasizing that while we work on financially sound structures, growth will always be at the forefront of our work in the ecosystem.\n\nOur responsibilities here will include:\n\n* Tracking and consolidating key financial figures, including revenue sources (AEP Licensing Fees, Timeboost, Transaction Fees, Treasury Management activity, and others that may arise), the DAO’s assets/liabilities, as well as realized expenses to set up and maintain in-depth financial statements.\n* Building models to project DAO financials and scenario-plan various budget configurations.\n* Providing recommendations for capital allocation, including ecosystem-growth targeting activities, income-generating initiatives, cost-cutting opportunities, and diversified treasury strategies.\n* Procuring service providers and conducting outreach to protocols for initiatives classified under the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council (GMC, TMC, STEP)\n* Supporting the DAO with real-time, bespoke financial dashboards, posting quarterly DAO financial reports to the forum, and ensuring the proper risk analysis measures are in place. This reporting will take place across all of the DAO’s financial and asset-allocation activity, including the assets that currently fall under STEP, TMC, GMC, and other future initiatives.\n* Working cross-functionally with all of the AAEs to create aligned, sustainable cross-functional capital deployment plans across the DAO’s initiatives.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to provide the DAO with the tools, data, and guidance necessary to fund innovation responsibly, while positioning Arbitrum to be financially self-sustaining over the coming years.\n\n### Incentives\n\nWe believe incentives will play a major role in Arbitrum’s next phase of growth, especially given the increased attention on dapp performance and ecosystem competitiveness. Our team will build upon the groundwork laid in the DRIP proposal to establish a long-term incentives strategy.\n\nKey areas of focus:\n\n* Continue leading incentive design frameworks, being the main party responsible for the success of approved programs\n* Draft and refine incentive programs, ensuring data-driven optimization throughout the programs’ lifecycle and that low-return programs are swiftly discontinued\n* Work with ecosystem teams (dApps, infra, new deployments) to scope incentive programs that accelerate high-growth opportunities sustainably.\n* Facilitate real-time data for the DAO to follow the progress of incentive programs, analyze the effectiveness of implemented programs, and deliver actionable feedback loops to improve upon them.\n* Interface with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure growth programs run by the aforementioned entities and the DAO are synergistic.\n\nEntropy’s goal is to bring structure and discipline to a chaotic incentives landscape. We see ourselves as the party relentlessly focused on continuous iteration, eliminating inefficiencies, and driving outcomes.\n\n### Ecosystem Data\n\nWe plan to double down on our ecosystem data work, expanding the scope and sophistication of our analytics to support every aspect of DAO decision making, while also serving as a protocol support mechanism that endorses native builders and attracts new builders, with the added benefit of increasing the ecosystem’s social presence. Both of the prior-listed roles around treasury management and incentives include analytics, but the data team will have an expanded scope outside of these 2 already time-intensive categories.\n\nKey priorities:\n\n* Continue building world-class dashboards and reports for delegates, investors, and DAO programs across all verticals.\n* Expand to more dapp-specific dashboards that showcase usage, traction, and ecosystem synergies in an effort to attract new protocols to Arbitrum while also supporting existing ones. These same efforts will apply to significant Orbit chain deployments.\n* Assist partners like OCL, the AF, and OpCo with analytics that track protocol upgrades, monitor the health of the network, and/or help track operational metrics. OCL, the AF, and other key stakeholders have already regularly reached out to Entropy for help with custom analytics, and we would love to continue this work.\n* Provide Entropy’s data infrastructure as a core asset for both internal DAO operations and external ecosystem engagement. Ideally, this will have its own custom Arbitrum-branded front-end rather than simply living on Dune.\n* Support institutions (e.g., TradFi managers) with data services (e.g., analytics for managers’ tokenized RWAs live on Arbitrum One) to strengthen the DAO’s relationship with them and to help establish Arbitrum One as the prioritized destination for institutions’ future initiatives.\n* Analytics around incentives and treasury management, outlined in prior sections of this proposal.\n* Handle ad hoc data needs as they arise. A concrete example of this includes our [Security Council](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-security-council) dashboard, which was created quickly to support the election process.\n\nBased on our experience, utilizing data services as a BD and support tool is an extremely powerful way to attract and entrench new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Providing these types of services is a valuable opportunity for Arbitrum to expand its brand reach and, as we’ve observed, having the ability to offer white glove treatment increases the likelihood of capturing interest from top-tier institutions and builders. Having said that, these white glow services are highly time-consuming on average, and under no circumstances do we want to divert our teams’ capacity away from facilitating initiatives that directly benefit the DAO without the certainty of conversion. Given these circumstances, there may be certain projects that are complementary to Arbitrum and are deemed as high potential for the ecosystem. In these cases, it may make sense to ramp up project-specific capacity and thus support the ecosystem both directly through ecosystem-focused efforts and indirectly through BD-related data services. In these scenarios, the Arbitrum Foundation will have the ability to waive Entropy’s exclusivity on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEntropy Data will be the connective tissue that powers smarter treasury decisions, sharper incentives, and more compelling narratives, while serving as a support mechanism for builders, institutions, and partners entering the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Special Projects\n\nEntropy Advisors will continue to act as a neutral strategic arm and flexible generalist operator for the DAO, identifying high-impact and ad hoc initiatives that fall outside traditional workstreams or require a novel approach. These are the thorny, under-owned, cross-functional, and/or politically sensitive deliverables that the DAO may struggle to tackle without a coordinated, trusted group stepping in. In many cases, the OpCo will be best suited to pick up some of this work with regard to occasional operational requirements, but given Entropy’s team composition, we may be best positioned for certain tasks based on our existing skillsets and relationships.\n\nExamples of special projects include:\n\n* Represent the Arbitrum DAO, when deemed appropriate by OCL or the AF, when dealing with external protocols that are considering deployments on the Arbitrum tech stack (similar to our involvement in the Ethena X Securitize deal to launch Converge on Orbit). Note that we’ve acted in a similar role several times throughout our initial term.\n* Help educate traditional financial institutions, typically those who reach out with interest in STEP, on the shortcomings of current tokenized RWA designs and opportunities when it comes to ecosystem integrations, and offer our time and DeFi-nativity to inform upcoming product launches in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Work with relevant partners to enable DAO-owned products that can diversify the DAO’s revenue streams in tandem with improving the user experience on Arbitrum.\n* Attend high-profile conferences and take on speaking opportunities to spread the Arbitrum brand. We will also continue to host “delegate days” in an effort to align key stakeholders.\n* Iterate on Arbitrum DAO’s early-stage support structure by bringing in talent and making it a more professional and cohesive experience that affords the DAO upside in the projects it helps get off the ground.\n* Miscellaneous projects as opportunities arise.\n\nWe will remain flexible in this vertical, focusing on initiatives that drive high strategic value but may lack an existing home within the DAO’s organizational structure. It may be necessary to approve ideas that Entropy will take on via a DAO vote if these initiatives require excess budgets beyond what Entropy itself can afford.\n\n### Termination Clause and Transparency Pledge\n\nThe DAO naturally retains the option to terminate this agreement through a standard forum → Snapshot process, requiring 3% of the votable token supply to vote in favor of the termination. Quarterly transparency reports will be directly shared with the Arbitrum Foundation at their request, which will have the ability to move a forum post forward with the same structure for termination. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment from accruing at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked (but unearned) for Entropy Advisors’ future base payments and the remaining funds of the 10M ARB set aside for incentive alignment will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\nOnce the OpCo has been sufficiently operationalized, Entropy Advisors will operate under the assumption that OpCo will be Entropy’s counterparty that will represent the DAO and act as its proxy. Moreover, we will continue sharing monthly updates with the DAO.\n\n# Overall Costs\n\n## Budget\n\nAfter reaching out to some larger delegates and key stakeholders to get feedback on how Entropy Advisors should proceed forward, it has become clear that a 2-year term mandate is desired to ensure alignment over a sufficient period of time in order to accomplish the aforementioned goals. Therefore, we are proposing to work with the Arbitrum DAO for 2 years from September 1st 2025 through August 31st 2027. We propose a base pay of $3M per year, a ~$500k per year increase versus our first term, as we have ambitions to grow the team to internalize key functions related to data, incentives, and treasury management.\n\nIn addition to our base pay, and in an effort to achieve long-term alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem, we propose a 5M ARB allocation to Entropy Advisors that will be locked in a vesting contract with a 1-year cliff and 3-year vest. In addition to the 5M ARB allocation, 10M ARB will be set aside for the OAT to negotiate directly with Entropy Advisors on establishing short, medium, and long-term incentive mechanisms. These mechanisms may include, but not be limited to, milestone-based payments, an equity investment into Entropy Advisors, bonuses related to Entropy exceeding expectations, etc. The Arbitrum Foundation will custody this 10M ARB, and must adhere to any agreement made between the OAT and Entropy Advisors. It is also worth noting that any terms related to an equity investment may fall under NDA. Our goal is to ensure the entire Entropy Advisors team has a large incentive to see Arbitrum win, and to ensure we remain committed to Arbitrum significantly into the future. It is also our goal to ensure the Arbitrum DAO can hedge its exposure to Entropy Advisors and enjoy the benefits of its future growth.\n\nIn total, we are requesting the transfer of $6M in ARB (covering 2 years) + a 100% buffer + 15M ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation. $6M worth of ARB will be liquidated immediately upon the passing of this proposal on Tally. 5M ARB will be put into a vesting contract by the Arbitrum Foundation in accordance with the vest above and 10M ARB to remain in custody of the Foundation for the OAT / Entropy alignment mechanisms. The remainder of the funds will be returned to the DAO treasury immediately thereafter. The vesting contract cliff will begin on September 1, 2025, regardless of the timing the actual vesting contract is launched (backdated if needed).\n\nThe Entropy Team will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments of $250,000 from the Arbitrum Foundation throughout the 24-month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time. If the DAO passes a Snapshot to end its engagement with Entropy Advisors, it will be considered binding on the final day of the same month it passes, and Entropy will be ineligible to accrue any further payments.\n\nWe are nullifying the terms in our Year 1 engagement proposal that stipulate the DAO will vote on a bonus for the first year of our services, and instead replace it with this structure. The ARB allocated as a potential bonus that is in the AF’s possession related to our first engagement should be repurposed at the Foundation’s discretion to cover this engagement proposal, or be returned to the DAO treasury if not required to do so. It is also important to note that Entropy Advisors did not claim the full $205,834 monthly allotments from the first engagement proposal for the first 4 months of service, so the Arbitrum Foundation should have ~$423,336 of additional funds slated to be returned to the DAO. However, we propose allowing the Arbitrum Foundation to use these additional funds to cover a portion of Entropy’s next 2 year engagement (assuming this proposal passes) to minimize ARB sales if it wishes to do so.\n\nEntropy will be abstaining from voting on this proposal due to a clear COI. We look forward to the opportunity of continuing our work in the Arbitrum DAO over the coming years. Entropy Advisors is all-in on Arbitrum, and we look forward to winning together.\n\n## Targeted Timeline\n\n* Forum Discussion: 2 weeks\n* Snapshot Period: 1 week\n* Pre-Tally Discussion: 1 week\n* Tally: ~3 weeks\n* If passed, 2nd mandate initiated: September 1, 2025",

    "description": "# Transfer 8,500 ETH from the Treasury to ATMC’s ETH Treasury Strategies\n### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Summary\n\n* Entropy proposes transferring 8500 ETH accrued from Sequencer and Timeboost Revenue from the DAO’s treasury to the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council.\n* At the time of writing, the DAO Treasury has ~10.5K ETH unallocated to any treasury strategies. This capital is currently sitting stagnant, and could be much more valuable and functional for the ecosystem within the ATMC, generating yield and increasing the DAO’s ETH holdings\n* An added benefit of activating ETH from the treasury is the potential to support liquidity in venues within the Arbitrum ecosystem to supplement increased activity from DRIP, while not receiving or diluting any of the incentives (the DAO’s allocations would be excluded from ARB rewards).\n* The ATMC has generated just over 43 ETH to date (beginning May 2025) by activating idle ETH from the treasury, with a 30D lookback APY of 2.43% on ETH-denominated strategies at the time of writing.\n  * At current 30-day-average annualized rates (note: proposed treasury deployments will not necessarily be in identical allocations), an additional tranche of 8500 ETH allocated to comparable-yield strategies could make the DAO an extra 204 ETH over the next year, or ~$891k at current prices.\n* The DAO treasury value is still highly concentrated in ARB tokens, and all efforts to diversify and increase the quantity of non-ARB tokens in the treasury that also support broader ecosystem growth should be considered.\n* Although the prospective increase in ETH is very marginal against the treasury concentration of ARB, these initiatives help grow non-ARB assets without requiring spot sales of ARB, continuing a long-term path to prudent diversification.\n* Deploying a portion of this idle capital to the ATMC is aligned with treasury management best practices: principal preservation, yield generation, and ecosystem support.\n\n## Motivation / Rationale\n\n**Opportunity Cost and Past Performance**\n\nAt present, over 10,000 ETH sits idle in the treasury, generating no yield and contributing minimally to the growth of the ecosystem. Allocating a portion of this to yield-generating strategies is in line with treasury management best practices.\n\nSince May, the ATMC ETH-denominated strategies have generated 43.4 ETH, utilizing AAVE, Fluid, Camelot, and Lido. Performance and a detailed breakdown of the ETH allocations, as well as other treasury strategies, can be seen [here.](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury-management-program)\n\nAssuming a prospective allocation of 8500 ETH and a conservative ETH-denominated yield of ~2.4% (illustrative figure based on the 30-day average annualized yield for existing ATMC strategies), the DAO is foregoing approximately 204 ETH annually, which is $891k at current market prices. Even at the lowest 30-day average annualized yield rate of 2.04% (recorded July 15th), the projected opportunity cost of letting this ETH sit unallocated is 173 ETH, or $756k at current market prices.\n\nFrom a treasury management perspective, maintaining a large passive ETH position without a corresponding yield strategy is suboptimal, especially when there exists a variety of deployments that would be appropriate to allocate it to, including but not limited to native staking, restaking, DEX liquidity provision, and lending market supply.\n\n**DeFi Ecosystem Support**\n\nThis proposal is in direct strategic alignment with the current DRIP campaign, fulfilling treasury management’s dual mandate of:\n\n1. Generating yield and growing/diversifying the treasury\n2. Supporting growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem, particularly within DeFi\n\nA major goal of the Arbitrum DRIP program is to spur activity within the broader Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem, initially focusing on boosting leveraged looping strategies within DeFi utilizing yield-bearing collateral. Decisions regarding these funds will prioritize supporting these initiatives where possible, deploying productive capital across various venues, though this will not take absolute precedent over existing considerations regarding risk, liquidity, partnership opportunities, sustainable yields, etc.\n\nSome indicative examples of DRIP-aligned treasury strategies would be supplying unstaked ETH to lending markets, or staking ETH with LST/LRT providers, and exploring adding DEX liquidity across native ETH and LST/LRTs pools. With some of these strategies, we can ensure that users who are looking to participate in DRIP have ample liquidity, and we can even make an impact by stabilizing lending market utilization rates, reducing borrowing costs or slippage.\n\nAs with prior deployments, we intend to communicate with prospective partner protocols to negotiate terms beneficial to the DAO or reduced costs on any deployments when possible or appropriate.\n\n## Specifications\n\nEntropy proposes that the new tranche of 8500 ETH be used in a variety of generally lower-risk, ecosystem-supporting protocols, including but not limited to\n\n* Liquid Staking\n* Liquid Restaking\n* Lending Markets\n* Liquidity Provision on DEXes\n\nThe 8500 ETH is not intended to mirror the existing treasury strategy deployments, unless extenuating circumstances indicate these to be undoubtedly the best option to support the ecosystem and generate risk-adjusted returns. The DAO’s wallets will be blacklisted from receiving any possible DRIP incentives.\n\nFor this proposal, we will not be conducting an open RFP process for protocols to apply for funding. Entropy will proactively engage with protocols providing services that align with our strategic goals. To have full confidence in the deployment of this capital, evaluations of various strategies will heavily take into account criteria such as protocol maturity, ecosystem impact, yield sustainability, and economic and smart contract risk.\n\nAs structured in the [ATMC proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-management-atm-council-details/29626), the elected OAT body will maintain full ability to approve or deny granular selection decisions. No allocation can be made unilaterally by Entropy. Funds will be sent to and custodied by the Arbitrum Foundation. Rebalancing needs will be examined as part of our normal treasury management reporting cadence, considering liquidity constraints, yield conditions, or shifts in ecosystem needs.\n\nGiven that the 8500 ETH requested represents a material portion of the non-ARB, unallocated treasury funds, capital preservation and long-term impact remain primary priorities. The following **benchmarks** guide Entropy’s allocation strategy:\n\n* **ETH:** stETH staking APY (currently ~2.56% based on 30D average)\n* **RWAs:** Avg APY of Largest Onchain U.S. Money Market Funds (currently ~4.11% based on 30d average)\n* **Stables:** USDC Supply APY (most liquid lending market on Arbitrum and currently ~4.54% 30D average)\n\nEntropy recognizes and agrees with delegates that at certain times a deployment to support ecosystem growth should be prioritized over a pure yield strategy. Our team weighs growth opportunities against foregone yield based on a few factors:\n\n1. **Estimated Value of Growth:** Does the estimated dollar-denominated value of the ecosystem opportunity directly outweigh the forgone yield. Elements that influence the estimated dollar-value of the opportunity include growth potential, broader ecosystem synergies, competitive landscape, and potential onchain fee impact.\n2. **Pricing the Opportunity Cost:** Evaluating the opportunity cost for specific growth allocations based on the established benchmark rates. This involves looking at the expected yield and rewards, required deployment size, and time to deploy/remain allocated.\n3. **Comparative Effect on DAO Income:** The opportunity cost is scaled based on its influence on the DAO’s total income. As Arbitrum’s total revenue increases, it allows for more opportunity to pursue growth. The percentage of Arbitrum DAO’s top-line revenue foregone for an opportunity is a factor in when a strategic deployment makes sense. An opportunity with more substantive impact as a percentage of total revenue has a higher required perceived value versus cost multiple to be deemed worthwhile.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Forum Period September 16th - September 25th: Requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions.\n2. Snapshot: September 25th - October 2nd\n3. Tally: October 16th - 30th\n4. Following a successful Tally vote: Begin deploying capital once OAT greenlights a granular allocation list",

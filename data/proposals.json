    "description": "# AIP-1.2 - Foundation and DAO Governance\nCategory: Constitutional - Process\n\n## Abstract:\nThis document (“AIP-1.2”) proposes amendments to the Constitution, and The Arbitrum Foundation Amended & Restated Memorandum & Articles of Association (the “A&R M&A”) and Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to (1) remove references to AIP-1, and (2) make other changes reflecting feedback from the community.\n\n## Motivation:\nAIP-1 set out critical aspects of governance and included key governance documents for the ArbitrumDAO, and The Arbitrum Foundation which referenced AIP-1 throughout: the ArbitrumDAO Constitution (the “Constitution”), the Bylaws and the A&R M&A. However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation’s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n1. Amendments to the Constitution ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.\n- Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation’s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.\n- Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.\n- Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.\n- Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.\n\n2. Amendments to the Bylaws ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n- Clarify that the definition of “Administrative Budget Wallet” includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the “Administrative Budget Wallet” defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn’t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation’s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.\n- Remove references to “Special Grants” and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.\n- Remove “AIP Threshold” defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws\n- Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.\n\n3. Amendments to the A&R M&A ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n\nLinks:\n- Snapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17)\n- GitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n- Forum thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58)\n",

    "description": "# AIP-2: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova\n**Title** \n\nProposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova\n\n**Author** \n\nJason Windawi, Alchemy\n\n**Type** \n\nThis is a Constitutional proposal.\n\n**Abstract** \n\nAs part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC [endpoint](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum’s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.\n\n**Motivation** \n\n[EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions.The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account’s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.\n\nEthereum researchers [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don’t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.\n\nOffchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint in the v.2.0.14 [update](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.14) to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nThis proposal directly supports the DAO’s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint was [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal’s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by [prominent EVM L2s](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/) [and others](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/700) in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.\n\nOur proposal is also aligned with the DAO’s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward [decentralization](https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226) beyond Vitalik’s second [milestone](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.\n\nFinally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum’s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nPR # [1474](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1474) on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol’s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint’s [design](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) allows for up to 1,000 slots. To accommodate this increase for conditional transactions, PR 1474 removed this 0 restriction for Nitro and for the testnet.\n\nAllowing conditional transactions also introduces a risk of DOS attacks spamming the protocol with transactions regardless of whether they meet the state conditions at the time they were submitted. To address this, Labs updated the Arbitrum sequencer’s pre-check to incorporate a backward-looking validity check of a given account’s state, meaning that transactions can only execute if they met their own conditions as of one second prior to submitting the transaction.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nThe work already done by Offchain Labs on this endpoint means that the steps to implement this AIP reduce to changing the load balancer config value as described above.\n\n**Timeline** \n\nIdeally ASAP, or as soon as is practical for Offchain Labs.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nThe upfront costs for implementation should effectively be zero given the work done already by Offchain Labs.\n\n",

    "description": "# AIP 4\n# Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit\n**Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\n* Disclaimers:\n1. The text changed slightly since snapshot (becuase of L2Beat's forum comment)\n2. This proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation *\n\n## High Level Overview\nThe ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.\n\nAn on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally’s user interface, and the respective audits.\n\nThis proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.\n\nThe motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.\n\nThe overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software’s security and completeness.\n\n## Path to a Smart Contract Enabled Election\nThis proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.\n\nThe activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:\n\n- Complete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,\n- Complete implementation of the user interface,\n- Smart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,\n- All parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation’s completeness and security,\n- Successful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.\n\nA vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.\n\n## Modified Start Date for Election\nThe implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.\n\nEven so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAfter all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.\n\n###  Revision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nThe revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.\n\nAll future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.\n\nFor extra clarity in the text, we have renamed “September Cohort” to “First Cohort” and “March Cohort” to “Second Cohort”\n\nFinally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.\n\n### Current text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.\n\n> This means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report \n\n\n### Proposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\n> The first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that was approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the ‘First Cohort’. The next election replaces the ‘Second Cohort’ and so forth.\n\n> The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\n> All Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\n## AIP 4 executable code\n\nThis document explains how to create a governance proposal, which can trigger an [AIP action contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x85792f6BF346e3Bfd3A275318aDd2c44A1058447#code). \n\nThe AIP can be created in https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/create\n\nTo go through the [governance lifecycle](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-lifecycle), the proposal's executable code must first trigger a L2 to L1 transaction through the ArbSys precompile.\n\nFor AIP 4, the `Arbitrum Core` should be selected since this is a constitutional proposal. \n\nTarget contract address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`\n\nCalldata\n\n```\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\n\n```\n\nTo verify the above the calldata, you can generate it yourself with the code from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/130.\nTo do so, you want to run `scripts/proposals/AIP4/generateProposalData.ts` then encode it as an L2 to L1 transaction to ArbSys, as seen in `sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts` from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/117639ff19b3c9a664fd92db4e0f4dbabb2a932b/sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts#L19\n\nThe deployment can be checked with https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/57758a4e203f43566f587a77282e8a078d1a9ce2/scripts/proposals/AIP4/verifyDeployment.ts\n\nThe side effects of running the proposal can also be verified with [governance-seatbelt](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "# AIP 6: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec\nDisclaimer:\nThis proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n# **Security Council Elections**\n\n## **Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n* [Section 3 of the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) describes this council in more detail.\n* [Initial Setup Transparency Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup) details the current members of the council.\n* [Section 4 on the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections) outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\n\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\n### **Executive summary**\n* This vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\n* A smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and has undergone multiple security audits.\n* This vote is meant to enable the smart contract system that will allow for the elections, as well as temperature check with the DAO.\n* A successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader [Arbitrum governanc architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/4f0714cf3651a9ebcddd5bb05b2f841314845c34/docs/overview.md).\n\n### **Implementation Status**\n\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is final and available for full review in:\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/commit/46dd56f55f4e0d96548fb6546122d47623c7a804.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched, the full audit report is available [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/6413778294037033c56a25f32ef766c302544a9b/audits/trail_of_bits_sec_council_elections_report_8_9_2023.pdf).\n\nA Code4Rena audit competition has also been completed for the election system.\n\n# **Background**\n\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution\nalongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum's smart\ncontract suite:\n* [Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (esp. sections [3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) and [4](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections)) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\n* [DAO Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md) - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\n\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the\nreader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n* [Open Zeppelin Governor](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425) - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\n* [Gnosis Modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-docs/blob/e5a669fa66a32aa4fc2ef84b219bc836e9328f6b/safe-core-protocol/plugins.md) - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\n\n# **High-level Election Overview**\n\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to [the specification laid out in the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections), is split into:\n* Election stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\n* Update stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\n### **Election Stages**\n\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\n1.  Nominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\n2.  Compliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\n3.  Member election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\n\n### **Update Stages**\n\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\n1.  Security Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\n2.  L2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\n3.  Individual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\n\n\n# **Election Stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Nominee selection (7 days)**\n\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration,\ncandidate endorsement:\n* Election creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\n* Candidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\n* Endorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\n* Fallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n* Custom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\n\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n* A new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\n* Candidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.* Delegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n\n## **2. Compliance check by the Foundation (14 days)**\n\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organization being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n* Calling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\n\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n## **3. Member election (21 days)**\n\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n* 0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n* 7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\n\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n* Split voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate\nSecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit\nfrom Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can\ntrigger a new member election:\n* Call the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\n\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n* A custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\n* These additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\n* The custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\n\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n# **Update stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Security Council manager update**\n\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n* Remove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\n* Add a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\n* Address rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n## **2. Timelocks and withdrawal**\n\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n* L2 timelock (3 days),\n* L2 → L1 withdrawal (\\~7 days),\n* L1 timelock (3 days).\n\nYou can read more about these stages in the [governance docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-delays). The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n## **3. Individual council updates**\n\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis\nsafes:\n* Arbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Arbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\n* Ethereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Nova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will\nreplace them.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nTo do this the existing [Upgrade Executor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#l1-upgrade-executor) on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom [Governance Action\nContract](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/README.md) will be used to call the specific OwnerManager `addOwnerWithThreshold` and\nremoveOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\n## **Additional affordances**\n\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\n1.  The DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favor and 5/6 of cast votes are in favor. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n2.  The Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n3.  The Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n## **Constitution Updates**\n\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution's text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\n### **Update timeline for the election**\n\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n* From T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* From T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n* At T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n* **New timeline.** A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n* **Less than 6 eligible nominees.** The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\n* **Installation time.** We need to remove the phrase 'immediately join the Council' to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user's right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 -\\L1 message.\n\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the\nConstitution with the following text:\n* **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n* **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n* **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n### **Compliance checks by the foundation.**\n\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* \"Prior to the next Security Council election, The Arbitrum Foundation shall establish and set forth more detailed procedures and guidelines regarding the election process for the Security Council, which may include, but aren't limited to, a candidate intake process in order to comply with Cayman Islands laws, a standard template for candidates to complete for purposes of their public nominations and other processes to ensure an orderly, fair and transparent election.\"\n\nThe text gives an affordance to the Foundation to conduct a compliance check on the potential nominees. We propose to make this check an explicit stage of 14 days between Nominee Selection and Member Election to allow the Foundation to conduct these checks. Details of compliance checks will be provided by the Arbitrum Foundation at a later date.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\n**Security Council cannot re-appoint a member who was removed by the DAO.\n**\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election.\n\nThe text focuses on how to replace a security council member who was removed by a vote from the DAO or 9/12 of the current security council members. We plan to update the Constitution to remove an edge-case that allows the Security Council to re-appoint a member who was removed by a DAO vote.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a member removed and they must be re-elected via the election voting system.\n\n### **Final update to the Constitution text.**\n\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \\'First Cohort\\' and 6 members in the \\'Second Cohort\\'. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmcny9xqHG9s9HduycwpooW4sV9VUMxYtVwU2eBts7vyYq).\n\nThe first Security Council election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that is approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the \\'First Cohort\\'. The next election replaces the \\'Second Cohort\\' and so forth.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\nAll Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election that starts at time T:\n\n1.  **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n2.  **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n3.  **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+21 days and T+35 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+21 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n4.  **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of security council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new security council members are installed.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The\nArbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\nAs a matter of best practice for maintaining an independent Security Council, no single organization should be overly represented in the Security Council. In particular, there should not be more than 3 candidates associated with a single entity or group of entities being elected to the Security Council, thereby ensuring that there will be no single entity or group of entities able to control or even veto a Security Council vote.\n\nFurthermore, no candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO, Governed Chains and/or The Arbitrum Foundation should be elected to the Security Council. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others.\n\nThe DAO may approve and implement a Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future Security Council elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\nSecurity Council members may only be removed prior to the end of their\nterms under two conditions:\n\n1.  At least 10% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes \\\"in favor\\\" of removal and at least 5/6 (83.33%) of all casted votes are \\\"in favor\\\" of removal; or\n2.  At least 9 of the Security Council members vote in favor of removal.\n\nThe seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a removed member and they can only be re-elected via the election voting system.",

    "description": "# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes\n# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes\n\n## Non-Constitutional \n\n## Abstract\nThree independent issues have been identified in the Arbitrum One Governance system and the current proposal aims to address them. Given this is maintenance of the system, after the forum discussion period it will skip the Snapshot temperature check and go directly for an on-chain vote.\n\n## Specifications \n\n### 1. Updating the airdrop distributor fee sweep address to the DAO Treasury’s address\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO airdrop was distributed to users via the [TokenDistributor contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9). The recipients are able to claim their tokens until the Ethereum block #18208000 (estimated to be created on the 24th September 2023).\n\nAfter the claim period is over, unclaimed leftover tokens may be swept over to the specified sweepReceiver address, which is currently set to the [L2 treasury timelock](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses). Per the [Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#overall-configuration) documentation, this should be set to the [DAO Treasury’s address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).\n\n**Fix:** \nCall the the 'setSweepReciever()' function on the TokenDistributor contract, and include the [DAO Treasury address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58) as the _sweepReceiver(address).\n\n### 2. Sequencer gas fee reimbursement parameterization\n\nThe Arbitrum One sequencer pays the necessary gas fees for posting user transactions to Ethereum. This is done through transactions to the Sequencer inbox.\n\nThe sequencer gets reimbursed for these fees in Arbitrum One. The reimbursement is calculated by ArbOS, but two parameters are currently incorrectly configured.\n\n1. The Sequencer Inbox has a fixed cost associated with including a transaction. The value is currently configured to 100000 Ethereum L1 gas units - this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getPerBatchGasCharge function. If you inspect transactions live in the system (sample from [June 15th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xd2eb2dea13148ac8080544cd4eb1df27ad984055760609b23664a54d6e3e24c4/gas-usage) and [July 17th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xe11e940a8e0e21c3092bf1785438351348d333a751f658838f0a90dc27813058/gas-usage)), it is possible to see that the fixed cost of including a batch is actually much closer to 240000 Ethereum L1 gas units.\n\n2. The ArbOS L1 pricing system features an optional “amortization cost cap” which is intended to subsidize the fixed posting cost for chains with low activity or AnyTrust chains whose fixed cost is much larger than other data posting costs. This feature was not intended to be enabled on Arbitrum One. As such, the cap was set to its maximum value, 2^64 - 1 (this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getAmortizedCostCapBips function). However, this did not fully disable the cap. As visible in the code, the amortization cap is only disabled with a value of 0. With the cap set to its maximum value, but still enabled, the cap would prevent the L1 pricer from taking into account the cost of multiple batches posted in the same L1 block. That’s because it would consider the costs of all but the first batch as having a weight of zero, because no time passes since the previous batch if the batches are in the same L1 block. Setting the amortization cap to 0 fixes this issue by bypassing the previously linked if statement to fully disable the amortization code.\n\nThe combination of these two issues add up to gas funds being incorrectly charged to end users, thus not fully reimbursing sequencer operations. This fix will increase fees for users but they will now reflect the actual costs of the system - it is expected to be a minor difference.\n\n**Fix** \n➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setPerBatchGasCharge(int64) with the intended value '240000'.\n\n➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setAmortizedCostCapBips(uint64) with the intended value '0'.\n\n### 3. L1 Core Governance Timelock scheduleBatch Bug\n\nWhen executing a batch of operations on the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49), if more than one operation creates a retryable ticket (i.e., more than one operation targets an L2 chain), the full msg.value value will be forwarded to each one. If not properly constructed, this can lead to retryable tickets that fail to get created. While there are workarounds, the current implementation is error-prone and the fix allows for more graceful creation of several L1 to L2 operations.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade the implementation of the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49) with the change [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/86/files#diff-93cdc770d0b61d15d694632048ac3aa46ff9dd5fa5bfae6b1310568b2e1df187).\n\n–\n\nThe fixes were implemented through Governance Action contracts and can be viewed on the [Governance codebase](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/7d6f4dac06ab98eaa0a4bef9c0dc09a9af6d67fd/src/gov-action-contracts/AIPs/MiscAIP). They have been audited by Trail of Bits and no issues were identified - the audit report will be shared publicly soon.\n\nThe Action contracts have been deployed to the following addresses and can be verified/audited by the community:\n\n* UpdateGasChargeAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7b1247f443359d1447cf25e73380bc9b99f2628f\n* SetSweepReceiverAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n* UpdateL1CoreTimelockAction: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n",

    "description": "# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n\n# Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712>\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980>\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768>\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490>\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775>\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562>\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549>\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86\\_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in\n\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170>\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b70f2da6f3b01f9a53dcbcb3e59ad3ad8bed924#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x54c2c372943572ac2a8e84d502ebc13f14b62246#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n`#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output`\n\n`# this script should be run in the nitro repository`\n\n`git checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\.go`\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n`git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)`\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n`$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum`\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)`\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: <https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf>\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff`\n\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

    "description": "# Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\nThis is a Non-Constitutional proposal.\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC's role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC's primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, @Immutablelawyer will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Security] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members&#x20;\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n***\n\n**Proposal TL;DR**\n\n* The ADPC (ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee) has the immediate mandate of overseeing the ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ recently ratified by the ArbitrumDAO.\n* The ADPC may add additional procurement frameworks that will be ratified through Snapshot.\n* The committee will research and propose a subsidy fund for security-oriented services within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. A ‘Means Test’ will be implemented to determine project eligibility for security service-fee subsidies.\n* The ADPC will establish procurement frameworks for various verticals and service types within the ArbitrumDAO.\n* Three members will be elected to the ADPC through Snapshot’s weighted voting system.\n* Eligibility criteria for members include experience, integrity, conflicts of interest disclosure, industry knowledge, analytical skills, financial acumen, communication skills, negotiation skills, project management abilities, ethical conduct, teamwork, technology proficiency, and decision-making skills.\n* The election process involves application submission, KYC/KYB review, and member election via Snapshot.\n* The ADPC’s term is 6 months, with a monthly stipend of 7,500ARB for elected members.\n* Operational parameters include meeting minutes, monthly reports, bi-weekly calls, and a public dashboard.\n* The ADPC’s Multi-Sig will be a 3/5 with signers receiving 1,000 ARB per month for their services. Signers cannot be Procurement Committee members.\n* Streaming of funds and clawback capabilities are implemented for multisig accountability.\n* The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* The Agreement will cover appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards for ADPC members.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nThis proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the ‘ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee’ or ‘ADPC’) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC’s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ADPC’s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ \\[REF:[Proposal \\[Non-Constitutional\\]: \\*\\*Procurement Framework \\[Security Service Providers\\]\\*\\* 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704) & [Snapshot 4](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.\n\nComposition of the ADPC \\[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]\n\n**\\[i] MANDATE**\n\n1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \\[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 4](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \\[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant’s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one’s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization’s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 1](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.\n\nThe ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].\n\nThere will be one election with the first three \\[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.\n\n**\\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**\n\n1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template stipulated hereunder;\n\n1. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following the end of Application Submission Period):\n\nApplicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes. All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates who fail the compliance process. Only applicants who pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for the ADPC election.\n\n1. Member election (7 business day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):\n\nA Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up, including the list of all eligible candidates. The three \\[3] highest voted candidates will be elected to the Procurement Committee.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ADPC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\n**\\[v] ELECTION APPLICATION TEMPLATE**\n\nApplicant Information:\n\nName of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative \\[If Applicable]:\n\nEmail Address:\n\nTelegram Handle (if applicable):\n\nLinkedIn Profile (if applicable):\n\nPrimary languages spoken:\n\nDisclosure of other time commitments:\n\nExperience\n\n\\[Refer to Eligibility Criteria] Please provide a brief overview of your experience in the digital asset industry and, more specifically, the Ethereum & Arbitrum Ecosystems.

This package includes a monthly stipend of 7,500ARB to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.\n\n**TERM**\n\nThe duration of the ADPC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.\n\n**ADPC \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ADPC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* DisruptionJoe \\[Plularity Labs]\n* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) \\[Premia Finance]\n* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)\n* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)\n* Dan \\[Vela]\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ADPC’s term using Hedgey.

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

    "description": "# Experimental Delegates Incentive System\n# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total costs: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\\* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1.

[\\[OLD\\] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![image](upload://jR5ofua1KGdUBlRqyh5OwcAlXCo.png)![](https://static.tally.xyz/e6a52900-773d-4b73-abee-6b68d095ce0b_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program, the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and it will be managed from the DAOs multisig.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. They have committed themselves to incorporating any modification to the dashboard, understanding the experimental nature of this program. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program and said signers would be required to undergo a KYC process.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @0xWenMoon\n* @cattin\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nWe will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma, nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Scoring**\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n\n**Minimum score to receive incentives**\n\n* TP= +60%\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\n* +30% TP\n\n**Parameter Snapshot**\n\n* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC\n\n**Dispute**\n\n* 2 days\n\n**Payments**\n\n* On the 13th-14th of each month from the multisig.\n\n**Incentive system administrator**\n\n* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate\n\n### Total Cost: 1,580,000\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n> **Note**\n> Costs may vary since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.\n\n## Reports\n\nSEEDLatam commits to delivering two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.\n\n*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*\n\n**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**\n\n* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.\n* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPlease note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.\n\nAt the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.\n\n## Modifications introduced post-snapshot\n\n* Karma integration (since option 2 won)\n* One additional parameter to include forum activity\n* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate",

It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective.

The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

    "description": "# Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process\n## Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes improvements to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council election process, which include:\n\n* Candidates are given a week to apply for a Security Council position before the nominee selection stage takes place.\n* Candidates need to sign a transaction from their EOA (Externally Owned Account) to apply for a Security Council position.\n* The ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect these changes as well as correct previous mistakes in wording with regard to timing and quorum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis AIP aims to improve the election process ensuring that candidates are not overlooked during the nominee selection stage and that candidates stand an equal chance of being nominated to the following stage of the election process, irrespective of when in the registration period they express their interest. It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.\n\nIssues with the current Security Council election process:\n\n* In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.\n* Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.\n* The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAccordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:\n\n1. A 7-day ‘Contender Submission’ stage before the ‘Nominee Selection’ stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.\n2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.\n3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account ‘abstain’ votes.\n4.

    "description": "# AIP: ArbOS 20 “Atlas” - Arbitrum Support for Dencun + Batch Poster Improvements \n# Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including the capability to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price. The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in [Ethereum's Dencun upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569) and 2 improvements to batch posting for Arbitrum One and Nova. The proposed ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will be ready for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain; this proposal concerns the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in [Arbitrum ArbOs upgrades](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nThis AIP combines following two temperature checks: [AIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513) and [AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbecc45a6beb55a708e25195f34db2f5ff757e0da5ff55171ca731b39428e27c3) - both of which have passed.\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS version 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-11/19696/) which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 20 instead of 12 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability.\n\n# Changes Included\n\n## 1. Posting batches of transactions as blobs to L1 Ethereum ([EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844))\n\nWith ArbOS 20 “Atlas”, any Arbitrum chain that settles on L1 Ethereum will be able to post transactions as either calldata or “blob-data” - the latter of which is to be introduced in EIP-4844 as part of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade.\n\nSome notes on how this is implemented for Arbitrum:\n\n* Applications on Arbitrum will not have to be modified or take any explicit action to get the benefits of using EIP-4844 (i.e. the whole chain opts-in with ArbOS 20 “Atlas”).\n* ArbOS 20 “Atlas” adds support for Arbitrum chains to send data in a blob storage format to data availability layers, like L1 Ethereum, that support the blob transaction type. This includes Arbitrum One and Nova. ArbOS 20 “Atlas” does not add support for Arbitrum chains to *receive* data in a blob storage format. This means that any L3 Orbit chain settling to an L2 Arbitrum chain will post data to the underlying L2 Arbitrum chain as calldata. The L2 Arbitrum chain will then be able to post data to a L1 data availability layer like Ethereum using blobs.\n* There currently aren't estimates on what the end-user gas savings of using blob data will be yet. This topic is something being actively worked on and monitored. Without mainnet data, the estimates for blob gas prices will not be accurate enough to reliably predict the cost reductions that users will experience - and even with mainnet data, the savings will vary by use case (i.e. no current way to predict the price impacts from all blob gas market participants yet). In general, however, the use of blobs will generally reduce the cost of using Arbitrum L2s.\n\nThis AIP includes a number of upgrades that enable Arbitrum chains to utilize EIP-4844:\n\n* Updated Sequencer Inbox contract with new methods allowing the Sequencer to post Arbitrum transactions in blob data.\n* Updates to the OneStepProof (OSP) contract to support the new Nitro fraud prover (mentioned above), along with a small patch to the ChallengeManager contract to allow changing the OSP.\n* Update to the Nitro fraud prover to support proving additional hashes, i.e., KZG and SHA256 preimages.\n* Update to the core Nitro node software to handle parsing chain data from 4844 blobs.\n\n**Nitro core changes:**\n\nCurrent full code diff can be viewed via this link: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/compare/consensus-v11...finalize-arbos-20>.

Enable partial support for Dencun Execution Layer\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade is technically a combination of two upgrades: one to the Execution Layer and another to the Consensus Layer, named Cancun and Deneb, respectively. While the Consensus Layer upgrades are not applicable to Nitro (since Nitro is Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s execution engine), some of the Execution Layer changes are, including [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) as described above. The full Cancun network upgrade specification for Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/1fed0c0074f9d6aab3861057e1924411948dc50b/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md).\n\nNitro’s upgrade to ArbOS 20 adds support for three specific EIPs from Cancun, those being:\n\n* Support the new transient storage EVM opcodes introduced in [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): `TSTORE` and `TLOAD`, offering a cheaper option than storage for data that’s discarded at the end of a transaction.\n* Support the new `MCOPY` EVM opcode introduced in [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) for cheaper memory copying.\n* Support the changes in functionality of the`SELFDESTRUCT` EVM opcode, as outlined in [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780).\n\nSince Nitro uses [Geth at the Core](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#geth-at-the-core), the above 3 EIPs were implemented by merging in a Cancun-supported version of Geth upstream. More specifically, [Geth version 1.13.1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.13.3) was merged into Nitro’s go-ethereum fork here:\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/284>\n\nWith the above merged, the below PR is used to enable the Cancun fork in ArbOS 20.\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/285>\n\n## 3. Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**Batch Poster Manager:**\n\nCurrently, both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, each have a single address that is granted the batch-poster role (this is currently the same as the Sequencer). The Sequencer posts batches frequently, and thus the batch-poster address must be controlled by a hot wallet. This means that if the batch poster’s keys were compromised, Sequencing could be unstable until the DAO took action.\n\nThis AIP proposes a system in which a “batch poster manager” role is granted to the operator of the Sequencer which has the ability to grant and revoke batch-posting affordances. This way, the batch poster manager could perform key rotations for the batch posters— routinely, and/or if a batch poster address is ever compromised — quickly and without the DAO needing to take coordinated action. Note that this proposal does not change the sequencer, but more so allow for easier key rotations on the batch poster.\n\nCrucially, this would not represent a change on the current system’s trust model:\n\n* In both the current and the new proposed system, the Sequencer is entrusted with managing the batch posting affordance; in the current system, for example, the entity behind Sequencer could technically grant batch posting to an additional entity by simply sharing it’s keys.\n* In the new system, the DAO would *still* have the same ability to revoke the Sequencer role; i.e., the DAO could update the batch poster manager (along with any batch posters).\n\nPR: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n**MaxTimeVariation:**\n\nThe futureBlocks value in the the SequencerInbox enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). The current value for futureBlocks is 12, which was set prior to the Ethereum merge. A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. This proposal increases the value to 64, two epochs, in line with Ethereum’s finality guarantees.\n\nPR: <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/233>\n\n### Dencun changes *not* included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade includes various proposals that impact both the execution layer and the consensus layer, as mentioned earlier. Among the execution layer changes, there are two EIPs that are explicitly not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”. This section briefly covers the scope of the two excluded EIPs and a rationale for why they are not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”.\n\n* [**EIP-7516**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516)**:** `BLOBBASEFEE` **opcode**\n\nThis EIP adds a new opcode to the EVM that returns the base fee of the current blob and is identical to the `BASEFEE` opcode introduced in [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198). This is applicable for Ethereum because it enables blob data users, such as rollup contracts or infrastructure, to programmatically account for the blob gas price.\n\nThis opcode is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum chains are not currently planned to support *receiving* blobs from other chains, like an L3 Orbit chain. Calls to the `BLOBBASEFEE` opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.\n\n* [**EIP-4788**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788)**: Beacon block root in the EVM**\n\nThis EIP commits a given block’s beacon chain root to the payload header for that particular block as a hash - essentially exposing beacon chain roots to the EVM. This is applicable for Ethereum because it improves the trust assumptions for a variety of applications that rely on data in the consensus layer. Examples of use cases that this would benefit include: staking pool, restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, and more.\n\nThis EIP is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum’s execution engine (i.e. Nitro) does not have a consensus layer and relies on Ethereum consensus for data security and data finality. Calls to the beacon root opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 20 “Atlas” this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash `cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` and can be viewed in <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/commit/cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749>.\n\nArbOS 20 “Atlas” will be shipped as part of a future release of Nitro.\n\nSpecifically for the batch poster manager changes, the difference can be found here: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/244>.\n\nAction contract deployments:\n\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x76d8e97cd4514bebbc21d2044ff4a8d9ea1f0cc4>\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x874356173cfd6c739aeab1f5abfb5f3afb3d4d33>\n* ArbOS 20: (Arb One): <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* ArbOS 20: (Nova): <https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0xce0af261eb511cb41b8d0a2e31df80ba37e265ab>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x501f30810d2b0eaec15cc3785dbb29e4a8a92a70>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 11, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v11`git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x8b104a2e80ac6165dc58b9048de12f301d70b02a0ab51396c22b4b4b802a16a4`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 11 to ArbOS 20, you could simply generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20 with bash:\n\n\\#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\\# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\ngit checkout consensus-v11\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v10-geth-files.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 11 and 20 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v11 go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 go-ethereum\n160000 commit 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6  go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.11.6 and v1.13.3, as ArbOS 11 used the former and ArbOS 20 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: [Git diff intersection finder](https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf)\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.3:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.13.3 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`. To also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

    "description": "# Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal \n### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power\n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay\n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1. The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n* The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n* The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n   \n  Increasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n   \n  On the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n1. The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n2. The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n**Chosen solution:** In the [temperature check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717) Arbitrum DAO decided to increase the threshold of the non-emergency Security Council to 9/12.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 4 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.",

    "description": "# [Constitutional] ArbOS 31 “Bianca” (Stylus, RIP-7212 Support, Nova Fee Router)\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes the activation of **ArbOS 31** on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This ArbOS upgrade brings a number of improvements, including:\n\n* Activating Arbitrum Stylus to enable developers to build the next generation of Rust or C++ applications on the EVM.\n* New precompile for verifying the [secp256r1 elliptical curve](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1) (as part of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md))\n* Change to fee collection on Arbitrum Nova, making it easier for ArbitrumDAO to manage and access the funds.\n\n**This AIP combines the following three temperature checks:**\n\n* [AIP: Activate Stylus and Enable Next-Gen WebAssembly Smart Contracts 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x330ed0f609da63cf4b67b932ab0665a76e1c7d6a7789f3383339bad79c789d2b)\n* [AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2f73825f375d59a5d3c8b05074e17140a4967e6ccb6fe20a58f836f865fcaae5)\n* [AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)\n\nA new ArbOS 31 “Bianca” was released between the time of the temperature check votes and submitting this proposal. ArbOS 31 release builds upon ArbOS 30 and includes new optimizations that were discovered during rigorous testing and feedback from Stylus teams. The ArbOS upgrade is shipped as a new Nitro node release alongside new upgrades to the rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n*Note: ArbOS 31 “Bianca” will be the canonical ArbOS version for the “Bianca” family of releases.*\n\n> **Since the DAO has already signaled support for the adoption of all three changes in all three temperature checks, this proposal will proceed to an on-chain AIP on Tally next.**\n\n# Changes included\n\n### 1. Activation of Arbitrum Stylus: a new WebAssembly-based (WASM) VM to support smart contracts written in Rust and C++\n\nStylus is an upgrade to the [node software](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) that powers all Arbitrum chains. This upgrade introduces a new WASM-based Virtual Machine (VM) that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, the Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM & is instead purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable. The two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. Support for more memory efficient and safer languages will unlock a new generation of applications that were previously impossible to build on the EVM.\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover were originally developed as a fork of the [Nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) codebase before. The Stylus codebase has since been audited ([Trail of Bits audit report 1](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-05-offchain-arbitrumstylus-securityreview.pdf)) and merged back into the Nitro codebase:\n\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  * Merged into the Nitro codebase in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #2242 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2242) and [Stylus v2 by tsahee · Pull Request #2425 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2425)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  * Merged into Offchain Labs’ fork of Geth in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #305 · OffchainLabs/go-ethereum · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/305)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  * Merged into the Nitro-contracts codebase in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #170 · OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/170)\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n* Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n* C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n* Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus 1](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction). For teams who are curious to learn more about how Stylus is expected to interact with their project’s existing infrastructure, we encourage folks to check out this [Stylus launch ecosystem one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FGC1sO5DlypyEW77r83GJUHuuipHGUY2Tvlvqr7GWk/edit).\n\nNote: Support for Stylus contract verification is currently under development by major block explorers. We expect that contract verification will be fully supported before ArbOS 31 Bianca gets activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, pending the DAO’s decision to adopt this proposal.\n\n### 2. Addition of a new pre-compile, to Arbitrum Nitro, that reduces the costs of verifying the secp256r1 elliptic curve as part of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md)\n\nPasskeys offer a solution that removes the need for a web3 user to personally store a private key for their wallet. Passkeys accomplish this by leveraging WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and can only be decrypted using a specialized hardware module called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming any compatible device into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.\n\nAdding support for [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) decreases the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve on-chain [by 99%](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212) when compared to current implementations, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Without a precompile, verifying this signature on-chain is extremely expensive. Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.\n\nThe specifications of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md), including test cases, can be found in the [RIP repository 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md). If approved, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will use this specification as the reference for implementation. The [Ethereum Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7212-precompiled-for-secp256r1-curve-support/14789) discusses design decisions, iterations, and the transformation of the proposal from an EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to a RIP.\n\nThis pre-compile is part of Nitro 3.1.0 and was added to our fork of Go Ethereum in [Add Precompile for secp256r1 conditionally based on ArbOS version by anodar · Pull Request #303 · OffchainLabs/go-ethereum · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/303) and has been upstreamed into Nitro 3.1.0. Nitro 3.1.0 is the minimum supported version of Nitro for ArbOS 31 “Bianca”.\n\n### 3. Update all Nova fund distributors to use a series of “fee routers” instead, while keeping the final destination as the ArbitrumDAO Treasury\n\nToday, the ArbitrumDAO’s portion of the transaction fees from Arbitrum Nova are sent to the [Core Governance L1 Timelock address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), which is accessible via the core governance system. This setup is disadvantageous because any time the ArbitrumDAO wishes to spend/move the funds, a roundtrip, constitutional proposal must be passed before the DAO.\n\nThis proposal updates the setup such that all Arbitrum Nova transaction fees, that are currently sent to the Core Governance L1 Timelock Address, are instead sent to a system of “fee routers” that automatically send all funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. Benefits of this new setup include:\n\n* Lower quorum requirements for moving these funds (3% vs. the current 5%)\n* No ~2 week delay to spend funds (since a constitutional vote would not be needed, as per the [Lifecycle and anatomy of an AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal))\n* Simpler accounting and bookkeeping, since all the funds would be in the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\nThis new, proposed system of “fee routers” results in a fee collection lifecycle as follows:\n\n1. A `distributeRewards` function call is made on the `RewardDistributor` contract, sending funds to a `ChildtoParentRouter` contract\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to `routeFunds`, the `ChildToParentRouter` creates an [L2-to-L1 message](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/arbos/l2-l1-messaging) which sends the contract’s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a `ParentToChildRouter` contract on L1.\n4. `routeFunds` is called on `ParentToChildRouter`, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\nNote that the addresses deployed during the [Snapshot vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65) for the `ParentToChildRewardRouter` and `ChildToParentRewardRouter` have been re-deployed at `[0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999)` and `[0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d)`, respectively.\n\n# Implementation\n\nAll of the above changes were independently audited.

Node operators may see a small increase in latency for Stylus `eth_call` queries, if ArbOS 31 is approved for activation on mainnet by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in [Arbos 31 actions by godzillaba · Pull Request #296 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/296).\n\nAction contract deployments for ArbOS 31 and Stylus:\n\n* Mainnet OneStepProofEntry (v2.0.0) (new osp) deployed at: [OneStepProofEntry | Address 0xa328BAF257A937b7934429a5d8458d98693C6FC7 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa328BAF257A937b7934429a5d8458d98693C6FC7)\n* Mainnet OneStepProofEntry (v1.3.0) (cond osp) deployed at: [OneStepProofEntry | Address 0x83fA8eD860514370fbcC5f04eA7969475F48CfEb | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83fA8eD860514370fbcC5f04eA7969475F48CfEb)\n* Mainnet ChallengeManager (v2.0.0) deployed at: [ChallengeManager | Address 0x914B7b3053B35B84A24df08D7c9ceBCaEA4E2948 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x914B7b3053B35B84A24df08D7c9ceBCaEA4E2948)\n* Arb1 CacheManger deployed at: [TransparentUpgradeableProxy | Address 0x51dedbd2f190e0696afbee5e60bfde96d86464ec | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x51dedbd2f190e0696afbee5e60bfde96d86464ec)\n\n$ cast storage 0x51dEDBD2f190E0696AFbEE5E60bFdE96d86464ec 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103 --rpc-url=<https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc>\n\n0x000000000000000000000000db216562328215e010f819b5abe947bad4ca961e (Arb One Proxy Admin)\n\n* Nova CacheManger deployed at: [TransparentUpgradeableProxy | Address 0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7)\n\n$ cast storage 0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103 --rpc-url=<https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc>\n\n0x000000000000000000000000f58ea15b20983116c21b05c876cc8e6cdae5c2b9 (Nova Proxy Admin)\n\n* V31 Wasm Root: 0x260f5fa5c3176a856893642e149cf128b5a8de9f828afec8d11184415dd8dc69\n* Deployed actions: [Arbos 31 actions by godzillaba · Pull Request #296 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/296/commits/1e42f3b818a4da1ebc5ff665a2ec0a80c6bebb67)\n  * ArbOneAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction: [ArbOneAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction | Address 0x19b715cf310c28c9020e53aaa11ce9df42e718b5 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19b715cf310c28c9020e53aaa11ce9df42e718b5)\n  * NovaAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction: [NovaAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction | Address 0x658afc9d5ec4476fa6bb7033ea465f9901fbff27 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x658afc9d5ec4476fa6bb7033ea465f9901fbff27)\n  * ArbOneAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction: [ArbOneAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction | Address 0xb040b105A4a0C7a9CC290164AcCBC32855368322 | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb040b105A4a0C7a9CC290164AcCBC32855368322)\n  * NovaAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction: [NovaAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction | Address 0x61703Bf337341f2e09d96Dd6488c2907718A8E26 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x61703Bf337341f2e09d96Dd6488c2907718A8E26)\n  * Nova SetArbOS31VersionAction:\n    [SetArbOS31VersionAction | Address 0x75C5a4532102DDFa44527B382990C384Ec1dD57D | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x75C5a4532102DDFa44527B382990C384Ec1dD57D)\n  * Arb1 SetArbOS31VersionAction:\n    [SetArbOS31VersionAction | Address 0x7ed9C3A779BE8b742AbFC17a2F15353ecBcE3e00 | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7ed9C3A779BE8b742AbFC17a2F15353ecBcE3e00)\n\nAction contracts, deployments, and Fee Router contracts for the Fee Router AIP:\n\nThe Fee Router contracts can be found here: [fund-distribution-contracts/src/FeeRouter at v1.0.1 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/v1.0.1/src/FeeRouter)\n\n* Note that during the Snapshot vote, a different set of Fee Router contracts were shared.

However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31 with bash:\n\n\\# !/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -e\n\nmkdir -p ~/tmp\n\n\\# This script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\n\\# This script should be run in the nitro repository:&#x20;\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v31\n\ngit checkout consensus-v31\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v20\n\ngit checkout consensus-v20\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Combine and sort nitro dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\n\n\\# Combine, sort, and filter geth dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, ~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v20 consensus-v31 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-20 consensus-v31 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 20 and 31 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v20 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de go-ethereum\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v31 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each Nitro commit. Then, you can again use git diff and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.13.3 and v1.13.11, as ArbOS 20 used the former and ArbOS 31 uses the latter.\n\nTo filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs:\n\nGit diff intersection finder\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 31’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 20’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 31’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.11:\n\n\\# This should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\n\\# Generate diff between two specific commits and save to file\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff\n\n\\# Generate diff between upstream geth and nitro geth, and save to file\n\ngit diff v1.13.11 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n\n\\# Run the diff-intersection script with the specified diff files and ignored files\n\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments:\n\n`--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'.`\n\nTo also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, [diff-intersection.py](http://diff-intersection.py) does a line based intersection.

    "description": "# Upgrade Governor Contracts by Transfering Timelock Roles to the New Governors\n### **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal will transfer the proposer and canceller roles from the current Arbitrum Core Governor and Arbitrum Treasury Governor to newly deployed Governor contracts. This roles transfer is a crucial step in upgrading the Arbitrum DAO's governance infrastructure.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis upgrade to the Arbitrum DAO's governance system was initially discussed as part of the 'Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO' proposal [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387). The community recognized the need for enhanced governance features, including proposal cancellation and flexible voting mechanisms.\n\nAs a result of these discussions, new Governor contracts have been developed and deployed with these improvements. To activate these enhancements and complete the upgrade process, we now need to transfer the proposer role to these new contracts.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1. Grant the newly deployed Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts the 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n2. Revoke the current Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts' 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n\n### **Technical Details**\n\n* **This proposal has a longer than usual L1 timelock delay of 10 days, so the existing governors can still be used for proposing until the voting period of this proposal has ended.**\n* The new Governor contracts have been deployed on Arbitrum One at the following addresses:\n  * Core Governor: `0x7796F378B3c56ceD57350B938561D8c52256456b`\n  * Treasury Governor: `0x4fd1216c8b5E72b22785169Ae5C1e8f3b30C19E4`\n* These new contracts include the following enhancements:\n  1. **Proposal Cancellation**: Allows the delegate who submitted a proposal to cancel it during the delay phase, before voting begins.\n  2. **Flexible Voting**: Enables delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes, supporting future innovations like voting from Orbit chains and more.\n* The new Governors maintain all existing features of the current Governors, including custom relay functionality and fractional quorum calculations.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThe rationale for upgrading the Governors by granting and revoking roles on the Timelock contract instead of using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern is discussed in detail in [this forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-smart-contract-upgrade-technical-details/24642).\n\n### **Security Considerations**\n\n* The [new Governor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/310) have been [tested and audited](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governor-v2-review/26118) by OpenZeppelin.\n* This transfer does not move any funds or change permissions on the Timelock contracts.\n* Historical governance actions will remain visible and valid.\n\n### **Post-Transfer Actions**\n\n* Immediately after this transfer executes, Tally will update to interface with the new Governor contracts.\n* Delegates should use the new Governor contracts for all future proposal submissions.\n* The old Governor contracts will remain on-chain but will no longer have the ability to execute proposals.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nIf this proposal passes, the transfer will be executed immediately after the Timelock delay.\n\nBy approving this proposal, the Arbitrum DAO will upgrade its governance infrastructure, enabling new features and improvements in the governance process.",

    "description": "# Constitutional AIP - Extend Delay on L2Time Lock\n## Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThe proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the *L2 Core Time Lock* contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n* **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n* **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied about how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n\nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by an additional 5 days.

It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this [diagram 3](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true) and the [docs 3](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n## Steps to Implement & Timeline\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of \\_minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the [L2 Timelock 2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract) contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.\n\nThe action contract is implemented and still pending an audit:\n\n[github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\n#### [Updates timelock delay 2](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\nSeatbelt: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34)\n\nAdditionally, we will need to update the ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n\nThe Constitution Text will be updated to the following:\n\n> Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n\nThe new constitution hash: `0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938`\n\n# Timeline\n\n* **Feedback Period:** 23/8/24 to 29/8/24\n* **Temperature Check:** 29/8/24 to 5/9/24\n* **ARDC Review:** 5/9/24 to 16/9/24\n* **On-chain vote:** 23/9/24\n\nThere is no cost to the ArbitrumDAO for the implementation of this proposal and an audit will be publicly available prior to the on-chain vote.",

    "description": "# Enhancing Multichain Governance: Upgrading RARI Governance Token on Arbitrum\n## [](#p-55784-abstract-1)Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal requests to regirster a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes with the upgraded token, reduce user costs, and improve overall accessibility for RARI DAO.\n\n## [](#p-55784-motivation-2)Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 → L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO) on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: [ERC-20 token bridging | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway)\n\n## [](#p-55784-rationale-3)Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible, by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum’s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## [](#p-55784-key-terms-4)Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## [](#p-55784-specifications-5)Specifications\n\nRARI token in question ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we’re requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO’s approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\n**The upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here:** [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305)**.**\n\nToken contract was deployed first in tetnests and then to Arbitrum One, and RARI chain (which is on top of Arbitrum One). All contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: [Tally | Rari DAO | RRC 30 - Enhancing RARI DAO Governance: Plan for upgrade](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588)\n\nThe executable code to create the custom gateway was prepared by Offchain Labs and can be found [HERE](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Public-Rari-Token-Register-Executable-3914a05c5bf94323a3d0d88abcc6576b?pvs=25).\nThe code was fully audited by Trail of Bits: [https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b](https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b)\n\n\n\n## [](#p-55784-steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (done)\n3. Change mapping for L1 → L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## [](#p-55784-timeline-7)Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal’s execution.\n\n## [](#p-55784-overall-costs-8)Overall costs\n\nN/A",

    "description": "# [Constitutional AIP] Activate Arbitrum BoLD + Infura Nova Validator Whitelist \n# Abstract\n\nThis constitutional AIP proposes upgrading both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to use a new dispute resolution protocol, called Arbitrum BoLD, and the addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist. Specifically, this AIP combines the following two temperature check votes:\n\n## [**<u>BoLD - permissionless validation for Arbitrum</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8)\n\nThis proposal requests the ArbitrumDAO to approve the upgrade of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to utilize Arbitrum BoLD: a new dispute resolution protocol that is designed to replace the currently deployed dispute resolution protocol. If this upgrade is approved, validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use Arbitrum Nitro software to post assertions and to challenge invalid assertions. Note validation will be permissionless on Arbitrum One but remain permissioned on Arbitrum Nova (also elaborated on further down in this proposal). \n\nThis upgrade will ensure that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. Arbitrum BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [<u>Stage 2 Ethereum rollup</u>](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). \n\nThe implementation of BoLD has been thoroughly tested and audited to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. Note that Orbit chains may choose to adopt Arbitrum BoLD as soon as the BoLD upgrade is generally available and formally supported, regardless of whether the ArbitrumDAO approves this proposal or not.\n\n\n\n## [**<u>Whitelist Infura’s Nova Validator</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xaa831b9306c3ec4f4a9b9731e7c445e540e5a24461a79f1166cb8dcdfa692d09)\n\nThis proposal requests that the ArbitrumDAO whitelist Infura’s Nova validator.\n\nThe addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network’s overall security, stability, and reliability. Infura has a proven track record in running blockchain infrastructure and has already been participating on Arbitrum Nova’s Data Availability Committee (DAC), but was not previously whitelisted as a validator. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP because both the adoption of Arbitrum BoLD and the whitelisting of Infura’s Arbitrum Nova validator will enhance the network’s security, stability, and resiliency. Both of these proposed changes will benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. \n\n\n\nSpecifically, passing this governance proposal would mean that Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will gain the following benefits:\n\n* **Permissionless validation** **for Arbitrum One** - Today, the critical role of being a validator for Arbitrum One is currently restricted to a permissioned set of validators in order to prevent [<u>delay attacks</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a) on the current rollup protocol - a class of attacks where malicious actors can delay assertion confirmations if they, the malicious actors, are willing to sacrifice their stakes. However, since BoLD mitigates the risks of delay attacks using a different mechanism (i.e. by enforcing a fixed upper time bound on dispute resolution), reliance on a permissioned set of validators is no longer necessary. Therefore, passing this AIP and implementing BoLD to secure Arbitrum One would effectively enable permissionless validation, marking a key milestone for Arbitrum chains to be recognized as [<u>Stage 2 Rollups</u>](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), a critical part of Arbitrum’s [<u>journey to full decentralization</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization). Please see the [<u>dedicated section and recommendation for Arbitrum Nova below</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Spt82k_wfCsYqljolpNUm8FdF8T3akCv11Wjyh8YLc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kdg6eaubi81k).\n* **Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation** - The current dispute protocol for Arbitrum chains has a ~6.4 day challenge period, during which validators can dispute claims about the chain’s state. These claims about the chain’s state are called “assertions”. While assertions are confirmable after 1 challenge period, malicious actors can open many challenges to delay confirming these assertions in a type of attack known as a [<u>delay attack</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a). BoLD guarantees that all assertions, if there is a dispute using the validating bridge contract, will be confirmed within a fixed time window of 2 challenge periods (~6.4 days each), 2 day grace period for the Security Council to intervene, and a small delta for computing challenges.\n* **Increased censorship resistance for Orbit L3s settling to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova** - As mentioned in the original [<u>Arbitrum BoLD Forum Post</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/pull/1766), the initial release of BoLD will come with a feature called ”Censorship Timeout” (originally called “Delay Buffer”). The Censorship Timeout feature provides stronger guarantees of censorship resistance for Arbitrum chains - especially those that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova - by introducing a programmatic way for the parent chain contracts to lower the force inclusion time window in cases where the L2 sequencer is offline or censoring. For Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, it is proposed that this feature be enabled by default alongside BoLD’s upgrade. Please see the dedicated section on [<u>Censorship Timeout</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Spt82k_wfCsYqljolpNUm8FdF8T3akCv11Wjyh8YLc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tsldt625ikrm) for more details.\n* **Preserves the current security primitives with a Safety-First approach** - In the event of a dispute using BoLD, there is a 2 day \"grace period\" (also called the “challenge grace period”) that is applied to the winning assertion before it is confirmed. This time window allows time for the [<u>Security Council</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council) to intervene if there are any severe bugs in the BoLD contracts that would cause an invalid assertion to confirm.The duration of the grace period is configurable by the ArbitrumDAO and would initially be set to 2 days. \n* **Improved network stability and reliability for Arbitrum Nova with the addition of a new validator to the whitelist** - The addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network’s overall security, stability, and reliability. Infura has a proven track record in running blockchain infrastructure and has already been participating on Arbitrum Nova’s Data Availability Committee (DAC), but was not previously whitelisted as a validator. \n\n# Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation is a critical milestone on [<u>Arbitrum's journey toward full decentralization</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization), while maintaining network resiliency. These milestones help ensure Arbitrum technology remains the industry-leading choice for Ethereum scaling solutions. BoLD directly benefits users through guaranteed withdrawal times and enhanced security, while allowing anyone to participate in network validation. Meanwhile, the addition of Infura’s validator to the Arbitrum Nova whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network’s overall reliability.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, this AIP is:\n\n* **Ethereum-aligned:** BoLD would strengthen Arbitrum One's connection to Ethereum by leveraging its security while making validation accessible to everyone - matching Ethereum's core value of openness. Similarly, the addition of Infura’s validator to the Arbitrum Nova whitelist would support Ethereum's commitment to decentralization by supporting a more diverse validator set.\n* **Sustainable:** BoLD is meant to secure Arbitrum chains sustainably in the long-term, and there are already future investments and research expected following the initial launch to ensure BoLD and its security guarantees evolve alongside the Arbitrum protocol, technology, and community. Lastly, by leveraging Infura’s proven infrastructure, the proposal would help ensure long-term operational stability and network reliability for Arbitrum Nova.\n* **Secure:** BoLD significantly enhances Arbitrum's and rollup chains' security by allowing more validators to monitor the network while maintaining Ethereum's robust security guarantees. Meanwhile, expanding the validator set for Arbitrum Nova will allow the ArbitrumDAO to reap the benefits from Infura’s strong track record in blockchain infrastructure, adding an additional layer of trust and security to the network.\n* **Socially inclusive:** Permissionless validation using BoLD would allow any entity, individual, or team in the community to participate in securing Arbitrum One. Validation is not restricted to a single address, as BoLD considers all entities that are proposing honest claims to be part of the same team. Where one honest validator may fall off, another one can take up its same responsibility. Similarly, by expanding validator participation through the addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist, the proposal encourages greater inclusion and representation in the ecosystem.\n* **Technically inclusive:** The BoLD protocol specification is publicly available [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf). The technology is permitted for use by anyone (i.e. permissionless) for the sole purpose of operating and developing an [<u>Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation.</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/Arbitrum%20Expansion%20Program%20Jan182024-4f08b0c2cb476a55dc153380fa3e64b0.pdf) Meanwhile, expanding Arbitrum Nova’s validator set to include Infura will enable more ordinary teams and users to benefit from Infura’s robust infrastructure and expertise for their needs with no increase in hardware requirements or engineering changes for projects.\n* **User-focused:** Users and developers would receive immediate security and withdrawal timing benefits with BoLD, requiring zero changes to their existing applications or workflows. As for the addition of Infura Arbitrum Nova’s validator set, developers and users alike will collectively benefit from improved network reliability and performance without additional overhead or complexities.\n* **Neutral and open:** BoLD has been and will continue to be “built in the public”, in line with how [<u>Orbit</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/concepts/public-preview-expectations#how-products-like-orbit-are-developed-at-offchain-labs) and [<u>Stylus</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/public-preview-expectations#how-products-are-developed-at-offchain-labs) operate. This AIP is made in good faith to be neutral, transparent, factual, and open for anyone in the community to critique and inspect. Similarly, the proposal to add Infura’s validator to Arbitrum Nova’s whitelist was made transparently, fairly, and in good faith for the Arbitrum community - following the rules and guidelines set forth by the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution.\n\n# Arbitrum BoLD: Implementation, Formal Specification, and Censorship Timeout\n\nThe following link, [<u>BoLD Implementation Deep Dive</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specification and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [<u>official BoLD whitepaper</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491). Additionally, the following link, [<u>Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum </u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes)[<u>BoLD</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf), presents the nuances and details around the economics in the current proposed design of BoLD. The section on the Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum BoLD covers topics such as: why bonds are important, how bond sizes were calculated, how to think about their magnitude in the context of designing a dispute resolution protocol and various ways the system is designed to ensure honest parties are incentivized to participate in challenges.\n\n## **Censorship Timeout**\n\nAs mentioned in the original [<u>Arbitrum BoLD Forum Post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/70?), the initial release of BoLD will come with a feature called ”Censorship Timeout” (originally called “Delay Buffer”). For Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, it is proposed that this feature be enabled by default alongside BoLD’s upgrade.This feature aims to limit the negative effects of:\n\n* Prolonged sequencer censorship, and/or,\n* Unexpected Sequencer outages.\n\nTo explain how this feature improves the security of Arbitrum Orbit L3s settling to Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, consider the scenario where an L3’s parent chain sequencer (the L2 sequencer) is censoring or offline. In such a case, every assertion and/or sub-challenge move would need to wait 24 hours before they could bypass the L2 sequencer (using the SequencerInbox’s forceInclusion method described [<u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job)). In this scenario, challenge resolution would be delayed by a time *t* where *t = (24 hours) \\* number of moves for a challenge*. To illustrate with sample numbers, if a challenge takes 50 sequential moves to resolve, then the delay would be 50 days.\n\nThe Censorship Timeout feature mitigates this by implementing a time threshold that is decremented when unexpected delays in assertion posting occur due to one (or all) of the above mentioned cases of censorship or sequencer outage. Once that time threshold is met, the force inclusion window is lowered - effectively enabling entities to make moves without the 24 hour delay-per-move.\n\nUnder reasonable parameterization, the sequencer could be offline or censoring for 24 hours twice before the force inclusion window is effectively dropped from 24 hours to a minimum inclusion period. The force inclusion window gradually (over weeks) replenishes to its original value over time as long as the sequencer is on “good behavior”. An example of “good behavior” could be the default and normal sequencing of messages without unexpected delays.\n\n\n\nBelow are the initial, proposed parameter values for the Censorship Timeout feature: \n\n* delay buffer = 14400 L1 blocks (2 days)\n* threshold = 150 L1 blocks (30 minutes) for Arbitrum One and 300 L1 blocks (1 hour) for Arbitrum Nova\n* replenish rate = 5% (meaning 1 day is replenished every 20 days, or roughly a 95% uptime)\n\nWe believe that the Censorship Timeout feature provides stronger guarantees of censorship resistance for Arbitrum chains - especially those that settle to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. As always, Orbit chain owners can change the default parameters as they see fit for their use case.\n\nCensorship Timeout was not specifically elaborated on in the [<u>original temperature check which passed on Snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8) but was [<u>mentioned in the original AIP forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/70?); we want to ensure that this important feature gets highlighted by adding it to this proposal text.\n\n\n\n## **Recommendation for Arbitrum Nova’s use of BoLD**\n\nIn addition to proposing that  both Arbitrum One and Nova upgrade to use BoLD, we also recommend the removal of the [<u>allowlist of validators for Arbitrum One while keeping Nova permissioned with a DAO-controlled allowlist of entities</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#allowlisted-validators) - unchanged from today for Nova. This update was made for two reasons:\n\nFirst, Arbitrum Nova’s TVL is much lower than Arbitrum One’s TVL, (~$45.48M vs. ~$18.99B at the time of writing Dec 27 2024, from [<u>L2Beat</u>](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary)). This means that the high bond sizes necessary for preventing spam and delay attacks would make up a significant proportion of Nova’s TVL, which we believe introduces a centralization risk as we would expect that very few parties would be incentivized to secure Nova. A solution here would be to lower the bond sizes, which brings us to the second reason: lower bond sizes reduce the costs of delay attacks (where malicious actors delay the chain’s progress) and therefore hurt the security of the chain. We believe enabling permissionless validation for Nova is not worth the capital requirement tradeoffs, given the unique security model of AnyTrust chains.\n\nNotably, since Arbitrum Nova’s security already depends on at least one Data Availability Committee (DAC) member providing honest data availability, trusting the same committee to have at least one member provide honest validation does not add a major trust assumption. In the case where the entire DAC is also validating the chain, a feature the Offchain Labs team has been working on, Fast Withdrawals, would allow users to withdraw assets from Arbitrum Nova in ~15 minutes (effectively the same amount of time for L1 finality). This is made possible by the DAC attesting to and instantly confirming an assertion. We understand that Fast Withdrawals will be the subject of a separate AIP.\n\n# Addition of Infura’s validator to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist: Implementation details\n\nThis proposal includes an on-chain action that will be executed, via a [<u>governance action contract</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/main/src/gov-action-contracts), to add Infura’s validator address to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist. For posterity, Infura’s validator address is: 0x0fF813f6BD577c3D1cDbE435baC0621BE6aE34B4.\n\n\n\nIncluded in the proposal payload is a call to the [<u>SetValidatorsAction</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf94afebfbf062a88615bc012da39d0822670aba#code) with Infura’s validator address. This action will be executed immediately after the primary BoLD Upgrade Action to set Infura as a whitelisted validator in the new Arbitrum Nova rollup contract.\n\n# Technical risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n\n* Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator is able to make a move when it should be able to;\n* Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n* Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n* Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\n<!---->\n\n* Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n\n\nSome of the technical risks that come with adding Infura’s validator to Arbitrum Nova’s validator whitelist are:\n\n* Bugs in the SetValidatorsAction that could cause the whole upgrade to revert.\n* An incorrectly specified validator address could cause the wrong validator to be whitelisted.\n\n\n\n# Implementation Plan\n\nBoLD’s implementation has now been complete and merged into the Arbitrum Nitro codebase as of [<u>Nitro v3.3.0</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/) and [<u>nitro-contracts 3.0.0</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/282). The BoLD dispute protocol is now deployed on a permissionless public testnet as of April 15, 2024 that settles to Ethereum Sepolia and has also been deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia as of Dec 11, 2024. Should this governance proposal pass, the target timelines for BoLD to get activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is expected to be on Feb 12, 2025 between GMT-5 09:00 to 12:00.These dates are tentative targets that will depend on the governance vote outcome.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n# References\n\n* [<u>BoLD Gentle Introduction</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/bold/bold-gentle-introduction)\n* [<u>BoLD whitepaper</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491), containing both the formal specification & mathematical safety proofs\n* [<u>BoLD Implementation Deep Dive</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/bold/concepts/bold-technical-deep-dive)\n* [<u>BoLD Economics Deep Dive</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes)\n* [<u>Announcement blog for BoLD</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-bold-testnet-live-the-next-step-in-decentralization-2a6cd39e9bba)\n* Solutions to delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups, a blog that highlights a core motivation behind BoLD’s development: [<u>Solutions to Delay Attacks on Rollups | by Offchain Labs | Offchain Labs | Medium</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a)\n* [<u>Audit by Trail of Bits (Aug 2, 2023)</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/audits/TrailOfBitsAudit.pdf), covering the first implementation of BoLD, based on the first design \n* [<u>Audit by Trail of Bits (May 2, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf), covering the new BoLD protocol contracts, assertion pooling contract, and changes to the sequencer inbox for the Censorship Timeout feature (then called “Delay Buffer”)\n* [<u>Audit Report by Code4rena</u>](https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-05-arbitrum-foundation) (June 17, 2024), from the public audit competition\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Aug 5, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-06-offchain-labs-bold-dac-rewards-updates-securityreview.pdf), covering fixes (from the previous audit) and additional optimizations made to the Arbitrum BoLD Solidity contracts.\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Oct 7, 2024</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-10-offchain-bold-optimized-history-commit-securityreview.pdf)), covering specific optimizations to make BoLD’s history commitments functions more efficient using fuzzing and differential testing techniques. \n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Oct 30, 2024)</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/assets/files/2024_10_30_trail_of_bits_security_audit_Nitro_Contracts_with_BoLD-90984d87c800f448601b84972e544e1d.pdf), covering further optimizations and changes to the Arbitrum BoLD Solidity contracts, including the review of potential impacts downstream of changes to support EIP-7702.\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Dec 26, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-12-offchain-boldfixes-securityreview.pdf), covering the BoLD upgrade actions, BoLD proposal payload, and other various small changes as part of Nitro contracts v3.0.0\n\n## Where to Learn More about BoLD?\n\n* There have been two governance calls on this proposal to date. You can see the meeting recordings here: [<u>governance call #1</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5GroqCAt9YY4fgFleHAlOUtZeotoIdX/view) and [<u>governance call #2</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L20e38nY_Fm_wLJvb8_TIncM4mVIq2A-/view)\n* Listen to the AMA recording on ‘Uncovering BoLD & Permissionless Validation’ that took place on April 18, here: [<u>x.com</u>](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs/status/1780643417522901337)\n\n## BoLD FAQ Document\n\nFollowing conversations with many stakeholders in the ArbitrumDAO and the wider ecosystem, we have consolidated together a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and answers [<u>here</u>](https://www.notion.so/93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990?pvs=21) about Arbitrum BoLD. This FAQ document will be iteratively updated as and when more common questions are raised.\n\n## Disclaimer about BoLD’s upgrade\n\nIf this AIP is approved, the confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-progress when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum Rollup chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to the parent chain, that were initiated before the upgrade, will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between when the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade would effectively “reset” the challenge period for transactions that are not yet finalized at the time.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the upgrade happened at time *t*, then a withdrawal initiated at a time *t*-2 days would need to wait an additional 6.4 days to be finalized, totaling 8.4 days (6.4 + 2 days) of maximum delay. Withdrawals that finalize before the upgrade takes place at time *t* would be unaffected. In other words, the maximum delay a withdrawal will experience leading up to the upgrade would be 12.8 days (two challenge periods).",

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] - Adopt Timeboost + Nova Fee Sweep\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP proposes to combine two separate actions into a single on-chain vote for the ArbitrumDAO to consider: the adoption of Timeboost and a Nova Fee Sweep action. Timeboost introduces a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and Nova. The Nova Fee Sweep action will forward historical transaction fees to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury, a task leftover from the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65).\n\nAs a recap, Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane on both Arbitrum One and Nova, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion. Use of bid proceeds from the auction will be at the discretion of the ArbitrumDAO, with the ArbitrumDAO having already signaled strong support for collecting bids in ETH in the [<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a).\n\nMeanwhile, the Nova Fee Sweep action applies to historical Nova transaction fees currently held in the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); these fees will be swept into the DAO Treasury with the use of the modernized fee collection infrastructure outlined in the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65). The full balance of ETH–currently 1,885 ETH–will be transferred to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One using established smart contract infrastructure.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\nArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come, First-Served basis (FCFS) basis. The original motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:\n\n1. Easy to understand and implement,\n2. Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation, and\n3. Protect users against front-running.\n\nUnfortunately, relying solely on FCFS transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution. This is because when opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest off-chain in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.\n\nTimeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\nHistorically, Nova transaction fees accumulated to the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) address, which required a lengthy constitutional proposal process for the ArbitrumDAO to access or spend. The successful passing of the [<u>Nova Fee Router proposal</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) redirected these fees to a system of \"fee routers\" that automatically transfers funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury, reducing quorum requirements, reducing delays, and simplifying accounting by consolidating funds directly in the treasury. As of 28 August 2024, Nova transaction fees began accumulating to a series of RewardDistributor contracts as outlined in the Nova Fee Router proposal, streamlining the revenue collection process for the DAO.\n\nHowever, transaction fees that accumulated to the L1TimelockAlias ***before*** the Nova Fee Router change went into effect remain in the L1TimelockAlias, totalling 1,885.79 ETH. This proposal intends to sweep these historical Nova transaction fees from the legacy L1TimelockAlias address into the new fee collection system. This will be a one-time task because funds collected after 28 August 2024 have been, and will continue to be, automatically forwarded through the new fee collection system to the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\n\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\n**Sustainable**: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured is already being collected by winning latency races on-chain.\n\n**Technically-Inclusive:** Timeboost allows any user to benefit from faster transaction inclusion via an autonomously-run auction that is open to all users.\n\n**Neutral and Open**: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins but pays the 2nd highest bid.\n\n**Empowerment:** The ArbitrumDAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\n**Operations**:**** Collecting historical transaction revenue from Nova enables the DAO to continue funding general operations.\n\n**Transparency**: Transaction fees will be forwarded to the DAO Treasury with the use of verifiable on-chain actions and audited smart contracts.\n\n\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\n* **Auction Contract:** A smart contract that handles the state, accounting of funds for bids, and various operations of the Timeboost auction. The contract is deployed on the target chain for which Timeboost is enabled.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer:** Off chain software that receives bids from Timeboost auction participants, processes and validates bids, and then posts the top valid bid (or top two valid bids in the case of a tie) to the Auction Contract to resolve the Timeboost auction. The autonomous auctioneer, for a given chain, is provisioned & deployed by an entity designated by the chain’s owner.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Express lane:** A separate endpoint for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.\n* **Express lane controller:** An address, defined in the Auction Contract, that is granted the privilege to use the express lane. These privileges are granted after verifying that the incoming transactions were properly signed by the express lane controller, among other checks.\n* **First come, first serve (FCFS):** A type of transaction ordering policy used by the sequencer in Arbitrum chains whereby incoming transactions are sequenced into a block in the order that the transactions arrived.\n* **MEV**: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.\n* **Timeboost:** A transaction ordering policy in which entities can bid for the right to access an express lane on the sequencer for faster transaction inclusion. See the[ <u>research specification</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design/tree/main) to learn more. \n* **Transaction ordering policy:** The rules and logic employed by a chain to order incoming transactions into a block.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\n* [**<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>**](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a): address that historically accumulated Nova transaction fees but was replaced by RewardDistributor contracts as a part of the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)[ to upgrade the fee collection infrastructure](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); historical fees held by this address are the subject of this proposal. \n* [**<u>ChildToParentRouter</u>**](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code): smart contract that, when called, creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract’s full ETH balance; once the message is executed, the ETH is transferred to a ParentToChildRouter smart contract on L1\n* [**<u>ParentToChildRouter</u>**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code): smart contract that, when called, creates a retryable ticket which transfers the contract’s full ETH balance from L1 to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One\n\n\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\nThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: [<u>https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design).  \n\nThe implementation consists of an auction contract, autonomous auctioneer, and changes to the sequencer:\n\n* **Auction contract** - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer** - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.\n* **Sequencer updates** - Changes to the sequencer include: background processes to use the auction contract as the source of truth for the current round’s express lane controller, new business logic to delay non-express lane transactions, and to verify and honor the rights of incoming express lane transactions. Additionally, new endpoints are introduced for the express lane controller to submit their transactions to and for the auctioneer to submit calls to the auction contract for auction resolution.\n\nTimeboost changes the guarantees around transaction inclusion and introduces two different paths:\n\n* **Normal path** - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged unless the ArbitrumDAO decides to do so.\n* **Express lane** - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.\n\nNearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.\n\nAll bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the reservePrice). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the reservePrice, but it cannot be lower than the minReservePrice, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the reservePrice does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.\n\nThis proposal proposes setting the **minReservePrice** to **0.001 ETH**, as the ArbitrumDAO has already signaled strong support for collecting bids in ETH in the**** [**<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a).  As mentioned above, the ArbitrumDAO has full control over how to spend the proceeds from the Timeboost auction, with 3% of auction proceeds to be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development. Governance can change the token used for the auction and the minReservePrice, at any time.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following data sources will eventually made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova:\n\n* Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)\n\n<!---->\n\n* A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).\n\nFinally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. \n\n\n\n# **Timeboost Implementation Adjustments**\n\n[<u>Timeboost’s design</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design) is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs. While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost’s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nTo that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, **this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years. The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances where doing so would enhance Timeboost’s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO:**\n\n* The right to adjust the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.\n* The right to change the maxBidsPerSenderInRound parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.\n* The right to change the reservePrice to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the reservePrice will simply be the minReservePrice.\n* The ability to rotate the auctioneer’s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.\n* The right to pause the acceptance and verification of bids. This is to allow the current sequencer operator to provide reliable, consistent UX and maximize infrastructure stability. \n* The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n\nShould this vote pass, modifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the [<u>ArbitrumDAO Constitution</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution). In cases where the ArbitrumDAO wishes to pause or disable Timeboost, the ArbitrumDAO may use the outcome of a Snapshot vote to do so (since Timeboost has an off-chain component). This special provision allows the ArbitrumDAO to react to market conditions quicker than what a Tally, on-chain vote would allow (~14 days as opposed to ~30 days). The transfer of express lane rights will not be supported by the Arbitrum Nitro node software in the initial launch and may be implemented at a future date via a regular node upgrade. A round's express lane controller, at their choice, can still sign transactions on behalf of others on a per-transaction basis.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the DAO-elected Arbitrum Security Council can, at any time, perform either Emergency Actions or Non-Emergency Actions to execute software upgrades, perform routine maintenance, and other parameter adjustments to Timeboost, in each case in accordance with its existing powers. These actions can include, but are not limited solely to, exercising the rights proposed above for the current sequencer operator. More information about the Arbitrum Security Council and their scope of powers can be found in the [<u>ArbitrumDAO Constitution</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n\n\n# **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\nThe full script for executing the Nova Fee Sweep can be found here: [<u>Standalone Nova Fee Sweep Proposal #303</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/303)\n\nThis script will be executed following a successful governance vote and transfer Nova transaction fees from the historical [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [<u>ChildToParentRouter</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\nOnce transaction fees are received by the ChildToParentRouter, the automated fee collection process will be activated, forwarding fees to the [<u>ParentToChildRouter</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code) on L1 and eventually to the [<u>DAO Treasury</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) on Arbitrum One; complete implementation details for this automated fee routing can be found in the [<u>preceding Tally proposal</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616). Please note that Reward Distributor contracts are irrelevant for this particular action as historical fees from the L1TimelockAlias will be transferred directly to the ChildToParentRouter.\n\n\n\n# **Steps to Implement**\n\nThe proposal to have Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova adopt Timeboost was posted to the [<u>governance forum in June 2024</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167), to gather feedback and facilitate productive discussions. Furthermore, a [<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot was passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a) by the ArbitrumDAO, signalling support for Timeboost and the use of ETH to collect bids. Since then, a third-party, independent audit of the Timeboost auction contract was done by Trail of Bits and all issues were addressed (audit report published publicly [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-08-offchainlabs-timeboost-auction-contracts-securityreview.pdf)**).** Finally, Timeboost went live on Arbitrum Sepolia on Feb 12, 2025 where teams have been testing their strategies and infrastructure.&#x20;\n\nSimilarly, the proposed Nova Fee Sweep action will forward historical transaction fees to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury, a task left over from the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65). More specifically, this action applies to 1,885.793 ETH worth of historical Nova transaction fees currently held in the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); these fees will be swept into the DAO Treasury with the use of the modernized fee router infrastructure.&#x20;\n\nThis proposal combines both the Timeboost AIP and the Nova Fee Sweep action AIP into a single proposal for an on-chain vote on Tally. If the on-chain vote on Tally passes successfully, Timeboost will be enabled on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova and the Nova Fee Sweep action will be executed. The exact timestamp of the proposed rollout of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is estimated to be done within 5 business days after the vote gets executed (assuming it passes).\n\n\n# **FAQs and Expectations for Timeboost**\n\nHere is a [<u>compilation of FAQs</u>](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Arbitrum-Centralized-Timeboost-FAQ-bba234acf92e476b8ca5db6855d7da45) based on questions received from the community.\n\nIf there are questions that are not covered in this FAQ document, please add them as a comment to this forum post, and they will be added to the FAQ document accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, a one-pager has been published that recaps a few key principles about Timeboost and summarizes the expectations around Timeboost’s use for chain owners, like the ArbitrumDAO [<u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167/106) for delegates to refer to when considering this proposal.",

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] AIP: ArbOS Version 40 Callisto\n**Type:** Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to **ArbOS 40 “Callisto.”** Callisto adds support for relevant Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) changes from Ethereum’s recent **Pectra** network upgrade ([took place on May 7, 2025 at epoch `364032`](https://blog.ethereum.org/en/2025/04/23/pectra-mainnet)) and includes a minor fix related to Arbitrum Stylus. Among the EL changes introduced are a way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract code directly from their own addresses (via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)) and new precompiles to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including BLS signature verification (via [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)).\n\n*The ArbOS 40 “Callisto” upgrade is being proposed for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, and therefore, this specific proposal only impacts these two chains, as they are directly governed by the Arbitrum DAO.* On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork. More can be read about the subject in the [overview of ArbOS releases](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/overview). Please note that ArbOS version 40 “Callisto” builds upon [ArbOS version 32](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) (previously adopted by the Arbitrum DAO); the version number is incremented to 40 (instead of 33) due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability, as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/overview).\n\n## Changes that will be included in ArbOS 40 “Callisto”:\n\n### [EIP-7702: Set EOA account code](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to set executable code at their own address, effectively adding account-abstraction functionality to EOAs. This enables features such as delegation, batching, transaction sponsorship, and sub-key permission control. ArbOS 40 implements full support for this new transaction type, bringing Arbitrum chains to feature parity with Ethereum’s Pectra account abstraction changes.\n\n### [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\nThis EIP introduces a set of precompile contracts for performing cryptographic operations on the BLS12-381 curve, improving efficiency and enabling secure on-chain BLS signature verification. ArbOS 40 integrates this precompile, enabling smart contracts to use modern cryptographic primitives in line with Ethereum’s upgraded capabilities.\n\n### [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\nEIP-2935 proposes storing an extended window of recent block hashes in the Ethereum state. ArbOS 40 adapts this to store approximately 27 hours' worth of L2 block hashes, allowing for more accessible and trustless historical data retrieval.\n\n### Minor Stylus VM Caching Fix ([#2998](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2998))\n\nArbOS 40 includes a fix to the Stylus VM’s handling of non-existent contracts in cache lookups. The fix is designed to make sure calls to `account_code` or `account_code_size` reflect the current state, even for addresses where a contract did not previously exist. This change is backward-compatible and does not increment the Stylus version.\n\n## Pectra Changes Not Included in ArbOS 40\n\nThe following EIPs from Ethereum’s Pectra fork are not included:\n\n* **Consensus Layer EIPs** (EIP-6110, EIP-7002, EIP-7251, EIP-7549, EIP-7691): These pertain to the Ethereum Beacon Chain and are not applicable to Arbitrum’s architecture.\n* [**EIP-7623: Increase Calldata Cost**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623): Although included in the Nitro codebase, support is disabled by default. ArbOwner precompiles allow optional enablement, but it is not activated in ArbOS 40.\n* [**EIP-7685: General Purpose Execution Layer Requests**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685): Not relevant due to Arbitrum’s lack of a separate consensus layer.\n* [**EIP-7840: Add Blob Schedule to EL Config**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840): Arbitrum does not currently implement its own blob schedule or native blob transactions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nAll of the above changes are implemented via a new ArbOS release and will be shipped via two separate upgrades: a Nitro node version upgrade and an update (to use the new WASM module root) within the on-chain rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal payload will contain the on-chain changes, including updating the WASM module root and scheduling the ArbOS Upgrade, and assumes that the Nitro node software for all node operators and validators for the network(s) are updated to a version that supports ArbOS 40 Callisto.\n\nAn independent, third-party audit by Trail of Bits has already been completed. The results from that audit have been published and can be found [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-04-offchainlabs-arbos40nitro-securityreview.pdf).\n\nNote that should this vote pass, the proposal payload [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/342) will trigger the activation of ArbOS 40 Callisto at epoch timestamp: `1750176000` which is Tuesday, June 17, 2025 4:00:00 PM (GMT) after the last step in the implementation process for Constitutional AIPs, as outlined [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). This is so that large, complex upgrades (like ArbOS upgrades) can be done so when members from the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, ArbitrumDAO Security Council, are available to assist if necessary.\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS 40 Code Difference\n\n[Click Here](https://www.notion.so/1f001a3f59f8800c8283e350cda357fb?pvs=21)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **\\[Completed] Forum Proposal and Snapshot Vote**: Initial proposal was posted [on the Arbitrum Forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-40-callisto/28436?u=entropy). The temperature check vote on Snapshot received strong community support and was passed [here](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7cc26491a070c74c1a4ec5a9892571d31eb690015936a35b52c0d3a97bd5497f).\n2. **\\[Completed] Engineering Work**: Features are implemented in the Nitro codebase, including support for EIP7702, EIP2537, and EIP2935, and the Stylus caching fix. The engineering work also included smart contract code changes to the Rollup contracts to support ArbOS 40 (e.g. `nitro-contracts 3.1.0)`\n3. **\\[Completed] Security Audit**: Trail of Bits completed a successful audit; results were published, and can be found here: [https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports).\n4. **\\[Completed] Release Candidate**: Nitro v3.6.0 was released and is now available on Dockerhub as `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.6.0-fc07dd2.` The release notes can be found here and this version includes support for ArbOS 40 Callisto. This is not the final release for mainnet but is instead the first release that adds support for ArbOS 40 Callisto. The release notes can be found here: [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.6.0](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.6.0)Should this vote pass, the formal and recommended Nitro node version will be communicated to the community.\n5. **\\[Completed] Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet Deployment**: ArbOS 40 Callisto has been activated on Arbitrum Sepolia on May 5, 2025.\n6. **\\[This post] On-chain Vote**: A formal on-chain vote on Tally will be proposed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO determine whether ArbOS 40 Callisto can be activated on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n7. **\\[Next] Upgrade Execution**: If the above on-chain vote is passed, the ArbOS 40 Callisto upgrade will be enacted following DAO governance procedures and activation timelines.",

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

    "description": "# [Constitutional] AIP: Constitutional Quorum Threshold Reduction\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a reduction of the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5%, lowering it from 5% to 4.5% of the [total Arbitrum votable tokens](https://dune.com/queries/4629041/7761813). The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet.\n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract has been audited, [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-06-offchain-setcoregovernorquorumaction-securityreview.pdf).\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. \\[DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. \\[DONE]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass. \\[ON-GOING]\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation. It introduces no operational, technical, or recurring costs and does not require smart contract upgrades or audits. Governance configuration changes are handled via on-chain proposal execution and incur only the standard gas costs associated with DAO transactions.",

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register $BORING in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway\n# Disclaimer from L2BEAT\n\nThis proposal is one of several similar maintenance proposals that have been put forward recently and require a constitutional vote.  Back in September last year, [we indicated](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096/39) that such updates should be handled differently, but no such initiative has been proposed so far. We have been asked to support this proposal, which we are doing through this vote. Separately, we will request a dedicated discussion to address these issues in future. However, such a discussion should not delay this proposal or any others of a similar nature in the meantime.\n\n# Abstract\n\n[https://superboring.xyz](https://superboring.xyz) is about to expand to Arbitrum, thus the $BORING token shall become bridgeable to Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation\n\n$BORING is used to incentivize markets and can thus help drive adoption both to the Superboring protocol and the underlying chain.\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrum wants to help scale Ethereum. Allowing tokens to be bridged back and forth is key to this.\n\n# Specifications\n\n$BORING on Ethereum is a simple, non-upgradable ERC20 contract, deployed to 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919.\n\n$BORING on Arbitrum is a Super Token - essentially an ERC20 token with advanced capabilities like streaming and scalable distribution. It’s deployed by the same deployer account, to the same address: 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919 .\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nAccording to the Arbitrum bridge docs, bridging to an Arbitrum token with custom logic requires registration in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway, which can be done either by the L1 token contract itself or by the Arbitrum DAO. Since the L1 token contract was deployed in the past without knowing this requirement, and is not upgradable, the latter option is needed.\n\n# Timeline\n\nSuperboring on Arbitrum is expected to go live in a couple of weeks.\n$BORING availability is not blocking, but would help make this deployment more attractive.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nWe assume the process of token registration to be well known and thus incur no or negligible cost for the DAO.",

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Remove Cost Cap, Update Executors, Disable Legacy USDT Bridge\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP combines and puts forward three separate proposals for the ArbitrumDAO to consider: [<u>Remove Cost Cap on Arbitrum Nova</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xeb044e3bdeba71e74dea02abeab4c33fe4bf5ab9def50082863702d5e2112b93), [<u>Update the Upgrade Executors</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc08147e229fa642ee7da2e5180f225122b8c517024902f21cdcd02b376179b8d), and [<u>Disable Legacy Tether Bridge</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd5a66f784523841511f7ffec4171b9c14404fdbf7c205086312084d19c95c193). All of the aforementioned proposals have previously passed a Snapshot vote, reaching a quorum of 3% votable $ARB. \n\nThe first proposal will remove the Amortized Cost Cap, which is expected to result in higher gas fees for users on Arbitrum Nova. This increase is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and reduce the financial burden on the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe second proposal will replace the Upgrade Executor contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet with upgraded versions. The modernized version introduces an additional function that enables the Upgrade Executor to execute an upgrade by directly calling the target contract, rather than indirectly delegate calling an upgrade contract.\n\nThe third proposal seeks to disable the legacy USDT bridge for Arbitrum One, given the activation of the new [<u>USDT0 bridge</u>](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) in January 2025. This proposal seeks to disable the legacy bridge entirely, rather than continue with the current configuration, which subjects depositors to a week-long delay and risks loss of funds if the depositor is a smart contract.\n\n# **Motivation & Rationale**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\nArbitrum Nova was initially positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to Arbitrum One, offering 30-50x cheaper transaction fees at launch. However, several developments have significantly reduced Nova’s competitive advantage:\n\n* EIP-4844 blobs: The introduction of EIP-4844 significantly reduced the cost difference between Nova and Arbitrum One, from 30-50x to a mere 2x. This difference is negligible given the already low costs on Arbitrum One.\n* Orbit adoption: Orbit chains have become a more attractive option for teams seeking gas sponsorship and customization. Their ease of deployment has led many teams to prefer Orbit chains over Nova.\n\nGiven the now-minimal cost advantage over Arbitrum One and the rise of Orbit chains, maintaining an amortized cost cap on Nova — which currently prevents batch posters from recovering full L1 costs — is no longer justifiable. Removing the cap will stop the Arbitrum Foundation from providing subsidies and align cost recovery with actual usage.\n\nAccordingly, removing the cap (i.e., setting it to 0 bips) would:\n\n* Ensure batch posters are able to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n* Eliminate recurring deficits currently paid by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* Reflect Nova’s lower strategic priority within the broader Arbitrum roadmap.\n\nHistorical data on Arbitrum Nova batch poster deficits can be seen [<u>here</u>](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/Public-Arbitrum-Nova-Economics-02zr64hC21SVqt2HSQjRLk/latest). ​This data highlights the ongoing inefficiencies and justifies the removal of the amortized cost cap.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\nThe Upgrade Executors controlled by the DAO are responsible for carrying out critical upgrades on [<u>Arbitrum One</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code), [<u>Arbitrum Nova</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482), and [<u>Ethereum</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code) such as protocol contract upgrades, system parameter changes, and more. Currently, the traditional Upgrade Executor contracts in place only support one function for executing an upgrade: [<u>execute()</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeProxyContract#F1). When called by the owner of the Upgrade Executor, the execute() function will perform a delegate call to an upgrade contract, which facilitates subsequent calls to target contracts and ultimately executes the upgrade. This indirect method of calling and execution can complicate upgrades and require additional development and deployments.\n\nThe modern version of the Upgrade Executor introduces a new function, [<u>executeCall()</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73), which allows the Upgrade Executor to directly call target contracts and execute upgrades, removing the need for delegate calls to upgrade contracts. While the existing execute() call is still supported, the new executeCall() function enables the Upgrade Executor to implement upgrades in a lighter weight fashion. In the future, upgrades that use this method may not require dedicated action contracts, simplifying the process and saving development energy.\n\n## Disable Legacy Tether Bridge\n\nHistorically, the existing USDT bridge for Arbitrum One was the primary path for bridging Tether to and from Arbitrum One. The new [<u>USDT0 standard</u>](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) introduced a modernized alternative that has become the go-to solution. However, the legacy USDT bridge is still technically enabled, which presents several issues.\n\nFirst, withdrawals from the legacy bridge to L1 are subject to a seven-day delay, which is meaningfully slower than the new USDT0 bridge which can process bridge transactions in seconds or minutes. Also, once this delay has elapsed, deposits are auto-withdrawn on L1. This inconvenience can be addressed by disabling the legacy bridge and directing users exclusively to the new USDT0 bridge.\n\nSecond, user funds could be lost if a smart contract deposits to the legacy bridge on their behalf. The legacy bridge is currently configured to auto-withdraw funds as soon as possible back to the depositor; however, this auto-withdraw configuration can cause problems for smart contracts that deposit on behalf of end users but do not have withdrawal or refund functionality. While it’s possible to recover funds in this scenario, it is certainly sub-optimal for smart contract operators and end users that delegate to them. Disabling the legacy bridge prevents smart contracts from encountering this issue and putting funds at risk. Also, once the legacy bridge is disabled, any transaction submitted to it will simply revert; this applies to third party integrations as well as direct user interactions.\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\n* **Amortized Cost Cap (setAmortizedCostCapBips)**: A parameter within the ArbOwner system contract that limits the percentage of Layer 1 transaction posting costs that batch posters are allowed to recover from the network. Expressed in basis points (bips), where 10000 = 100%.\n* **ArbOwner Contract**: A privileged precompiled contract that allows the ArbitrumDAO to configure core protocol settings, such as the amortized cost cap.\n* **EIP-4844**: An Ethereum Improvement Proposal introducing blob-carrying transactions. Its implementation has significantly reduced the cost disparity between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, undermining the original economic rationale for Nova’s fee model.\n* **Batch poster transactions**: Transactions that aggregate multiple operations and submit them as a single on-chain transaction. With the enforced fee cap, these transactions become less cost-effective under current network dynamics, contributing to operational inefficiencies.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\n* **Upgrade Executor**: A smart contract responsible for executing upgrades on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet; owned and administered by the DAO\n* **Upgrade Contract**: A smart contract that contains dedicated logic for a particular upgrade; receives a call from the Upgrade Executor and subsequently calls other contracts targeted in that upgrade\n* **execute()**: The sole function for executing an upgrade in existing Upgrade Executor implementations; relies on indirect delegate calls to upgrade contracts\n* **executeCall()**: A [<u>new function</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73) for executing an upgrade in the modern Upgrade Executor implementation; allows for direct calls to target contracts. A new [<u>audit report</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/assets/files/2025-07-offchainlabs-upgrade-executor-report-900fbe3a31c6ca81e2949355f6134d33.pdf) was recently completed. Trail of Bits reviewed the implementation of executeCall, assessed it against the proposal’s intent, and checked for unintended side effects. Trail of Bits found no security-relevant issues. \n\n## Disable Legacy Tether Bridge\n\n* **USDT0**: Tether’s new OFT-based version of USDT; more details here\n* DisableGatewayAction: A smart contract action that disables a gateway for a specified token from the [<u>L1GatewayRouter</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72ce9c846789fdb6fc1f34ac4ad25dd9ef7031ef#code); the DisableGatewayAction source code can be found [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/token-bridge/DisableGatewayAction.sol)\n\n# **Specifications & Steps to Implement**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\nThe DAO will execute a call to the [<u>ArbOwner contract</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/c32af127fe6a9124316abebbf756609649ede1f5/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L129C14-L129C37) on Arbitrum Nova to set the amortizedCostCapBips value to 0, thereby allowing batch posters to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\n* Deploy the latest [<u>UpgradeExecutor</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/main/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol) contract on each network\n* Update proxy contracts on each network to reflect new UpgradeExecutor addresses:\n  * Arbitrum One: [<u>0xCF57572261c7c2BCF21ffD220ea7d1a27D40A827</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n  * Arbitrum Nova: [<u>0x86a02dD71363c440b21F4c0E5B2Ad01Ffe1A7482</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n  * Ethereum: [<u>0x3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n\n1. Deploy new UpgradeExecutor contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum using the parameters specified above\n2.

    "description": "# [Constitutional] AIP: Activate ArbOS 51 (Dia) and Gas Pricing Updates\n**Type:** Constitutional AIP\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP proposes the activation of ArbOS 51: Dia on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova as well as increases to the gas target and min L2 base fee, along with changes to the L2 pricing algorithm. This on-chain vote proposes to bundle together the following two temperature check votes:\n\n1. [<u>AIP: ArbOS 51 Version 51 Dia</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x33754da4006d0ef38666ec5d5e85fd0966a891a594ab9dc21f23beedea2d330b): which contains relevant Fusaka EIPs, the addition of a MaxTxGasLimit allowing full block utilization, changes to instrument Nitro’s State Transition Function (STF) to price gas based on specific resource usage, native token mint/burn capabilities, and a few bug fixes. \n2. [<u>AIP: Raise the gas target, implement improvements to the pricing algorithm, and raise the L2 min base fee</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5)\n\nThe combination of ArbOS 51 and the gas-target/pricing updates will ship as a single integrated release, designated ArbOS 51, which supersedes the originally planned standalone activation of ArbOS 50.\n\nSince the ArbitrumDAO has already signaled support for the adoption of the above two AIPs in their respective temperature check votes, this on-chain vote will bundle both of these AIPs for activation on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova with the ArbOS 51 release. Please visit the forum posts for each of the AIPs to learn more.\n\nThe ArbOS 51 release builds upon ArbOS 40 Callisto and will be shipped as a new mandatory Nitro release and new versions of the rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, should the ArbitrumDAO vote to pass this proposal. This proposal increments the ArbOS version number to 5x instead of 4x due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability, as explained[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\nThis proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the ArbitrumDAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\n## **Changes Included**\n\n### **1.**  [ **<u>Activation of ArbOS 51 Dia</u>**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835)\n\nArbOS 51 Dia enables full Fusaka compatibility while introducing native Arbitrum improvements. Visit the original[ <u>Forum Post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835) to read more details about the proposed changes. Key components include of this ArbOS 51 release include:\n\n* [<u>EIP-7951</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7951): Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support\n* [<u>EIP-7825</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825): Transaction Gas Limit Cap\n* [<u>EIP-7642</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642): eth/69 - history expiry and simpler receipts\n* [<u>EIP-7939</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7939): Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcode\n* [<u>EIP-7823</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823): Set upper bounds for MODEXP\n* [<u>EIP-7883</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883): ModExp Gas Cost Increase\n* [<u>EIP-7910</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7910): eth\\_config JSON-RPC Method\n* Enable[ <u>EIP-2537</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537): Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations\n* Introduce an “Effective Block Gas Limit” in the STF, with a MaxTxGasLimit of 32M gas. The total Effective Block Gas Limit becomes 64M gas (MaxTxGasLimit + MaxBlockGasLimit). This doesn’t change the GasTarget or overall gas per second, only how gas is distributed across blocks.\n* Instrumentation of the State Transition Function (STF) to track transaction gas consumption across multiple resource types, rather than a single total based on opcodes, including: computation, storage growth, storage access, history growth, and calldata. This work lays the foundation for dynamic, resource-based pricing where fees can adjust based on the most constrained resource on the network and represent one part of Arbitrum’s scaling strategy for lower, more stable fees as demand grows.This[ <u>explainer blog</u>](https://blog.arbitrum.io/dynamic-pricing-explainer/) and[ <u>Vitalik’s post on Multidimensional gas pricing</u>](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/09/multidim.html) are great resources to learn more about this approach to improving how the EVM prices network resource usage.\n* Native token mint/burn to allow an Arbitrum chain to delegate minting and burning of its native gas token to a trusted bridge provider. Native Token Mint/Burn is proposed to be included in ArbOS 51 Dia for the benefit of Arbitrum Orbit chains (reducing the need for forks) and to streamline development and testing into a single codebase. There are no plans to enable this feature on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova,\\*\\*\\*\\* consequently this feature will be explicitly left disabled for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

Visit the original[ <u>Forum Post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835) to read more details about these EIPs and our decision not to propose them for inclusion in ArbOS 51:\n\n* [<u>EIP-7594</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594),[ <u>EIP-7918</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7918), and[ <u>EIP-7892</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892): Arbitrum chains do not have blob data markets, nor do they support posting blob data to a non-Arbitrum parent chain\n* [<u>EIP-7917</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7917): Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain, and therefore, do not have a peer-to-peer layer like Ethereum does\n* [<u>EIP-7934</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934): Arbitrum does not propagate blocks between nodes\n* [<u>EIP-7935</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7935): Arbitrum blocks are built differently from those on Ethereum, with different assumptions and mechanics. Therefore, an increase in Ethereum block’s size limit does not need to be replicated or matched with an increase in Arbitrum block size limit.\n\n### **2.**  [ **<u>Raising the gas target, increasing the min L2 base fee, & improving the pricing algorithm</u>**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182)\n\nAs part of our strategy for scaling Arbitrum technology, this proposal includes the AIP to improve the pricing algorithm for Arbitrum One and Nova to reduce the severity, frequency, and duration of high L2 gas prices during periods of elevated demand on the network. Concretely, the proposed changes are to:\n\n* Replace the current single gas target and single adjustment window, with a new model that employs multiple (higher) gas targets, measured over multiple adjustment windows,\n* Raise the long term effective gas target, up from today’s single gas target of 7 Mgas/s (up to a maximum of 100 Mgas/s),\n* Grant Offchain Labs, in its role as an Arbitrum Aligned Entity, the permission to make additional changes gradually to scale the chain sustainably, and\n* Increase the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 gwei per gas to 0.02 gwei per gas.\n\nThe rationale for this change, alongside details on the specifications and supporting data, can be found[ <u>here in the original AIP</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182).\n\n## **Implementation Details**\n\nAll of the above changes are implemented in a release of Arbitrum Nitro and will be shipped via two separate upgrades: a Nitro node version upgrade and an update with the on-chain rollup contracts on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Should this proposal pass, the payload will be executed on-chain and will include the relevant on-chain contract changes, updating the WASM module root, and scheduling of the ArbOS upgrade. The proposed payload changes assume that the Nitro node software for all node operators and validators for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova are updated to a version that supports ArbOS 51.\n\n**Audit reports**\n\nAn independent, third-party audit by Trail of Bits has been completed and the results from the audit can be found below:\n\n* [<u>https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports)\n\n**Proposal payload activation details and dates**\n\nNote that should this vote pass, the proposal payload[ <u>here</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/366) will trigger the activation of ArbOS 51 at epoch timestamp 17:00:00 UTC on Thursday, January 8, 2026, which is the last step in the implementation process for Constitutional AIPs, as outlined[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). This specific date was chosen so that large, complex upgrades (like ArbOS upgrades) can be done so when members from the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, and ArbitrumDAO Security Council, are available to assist if necessary.\n\n**Verifying the ArbOS 51 code difference**\n\n[<u>Click here</u>](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Verifying-the-ArbOS-50-Code-Difference-2a501a3f59f8804cb0a0f9a460020a9d)\n\n## **Implementation Steps**\n\n1. **\\[Completed] Forum Proposals and Snapshot Votes**: The included proposals for this vote were initially posted on the ArbitrumDAO forums[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835) and[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182). Following discussions with the broader ArbitrumDAO, these proposals were put up for a temperature check vote, where they passed,[ <u>here</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x33754da4006d0ef38666ec5d5e85fd0966a891a594ab9dc21f23beedea2d330b) and[ <u>here</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5), respectively.\n2. **\\[Completed] Engineering Work**: Features were implemented and tested in the Nitro codebase. The engineering work also included smart contract code changes to the Rollup contracts to support ArbOS 51 (nitro-contracts 3.1.0 & nitro-contracts 3.1.1)\n3. **\\[Completed] Security Audit**: Trail of Bits completed a successful audit; results were published, and can be found here:[ <u>https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports).\n4. **\\[Completed] Release Candidate**: Nitro v3.9.3 was released and is now available on Dockerhub as offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.9.3-8bc5554. The release notes can be found here and this version includes support for ArbOS 51. This is not the final release for mainnet but is instead the first release that adds support for ArbOS 51. The release notes can be found here:[ <u>https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3). Should this vote pass, the formal and recommended Nitro node version will be communicated to the community.\n5. **\\[Completed] Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet Deployment**: The originally planned ArbOS 50 Dia has been activated on Arbitrum Sepolia on Thursday November 20 2025.\n6. **\\[Completed] Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet Deployment**: ArbOS 51 has been activated on Arbitrum Sepolia on Monday December 1, 2025\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n7. **\\[This post] On-chain Vote**: A formal on-chain vote on Tally will be proposed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO to determine whether ArbOS 51 can be activated on Arbitrum One and Nova\n8. **\\[Next] Upgrade Execution**: If the above on-chain vote is passed, the ArbOS 51 upgrade will be enacted following[ <u>ArbitrumDAO governance procedures and activation timelines</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal).
